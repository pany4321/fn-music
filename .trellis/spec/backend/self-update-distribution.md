# Sideload Self-Update Distribution Contract

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply this contract whenever changing the sideload update client, update Compose state, release APK
workflow, `release-metadata.json`, the Cloudflare publisher, or R2 object layout. These parts form one
security and ordering boundary:

```text
version.properties → signed GitHub APK + metadata → publisher → R2 update.json → Android installer
```

The `store` flavor is outside this pipeline and must remain unable to request package installation.

## 2. Signatures

```text

  FN_MUSIC_UPDATE_MANIFEST_URL=https://<r2-custom-domain>/update.json
  -PfnMusicUpdateManifestUrl=<same value>

  POST /api/config
  POST /api/preflight
  POST /api/publish

Worker Secret:
  GITHUB_TOKEN=<fine-grained PAT scoped to QiaoKes/fn-music-tv>
```

R2 binding is named `UPDATE_BUCKET`. The App never receives this binding or Cloudflare credentials.

## 3. Contracts

### Release metadata

`release-metadata.json` has these required fields:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "packageName": "com.fnmusic.tv",
  "versionName": "1.0.6",
  "versionCode": 22,
  "apk": {
    "fileName": "fn-music-tv-1.0.6-universal.apk",
    "size": 5560000,
    "sha256": "64 lowercase hex",
    "signingCertificateSha256": "64 lowercase hex"
  },
  "builtAt": "ISO-8601 UTC",
  "commitSha": "40 lowercase hex"
}
```

CI derives version fields from `version.properties`, file fields from the final renamed APK, signer
identity from successful `apksigner --print-certs`, and commit from `GITHUB_SHA`. `builtAt` must use
the exact UTC shape `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`; fixture overrides must pass the same validation. The
publisher must match metadata to exactly one APK asset and the GitHub asset digest before writing R2.

### Public update manifest

`update.json` has these required fields:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "packageName": "com.fnmusic.tv",
  "versionName": "1.0.6",
  "versionCode": 22,
  "title": "v1.0.6",
  "notes": "plain text, at most 4000 characters",
  "apk": {
    "url": "https://download.example.com/releases/22/app.apk",
    "size": 5560000,
    "sha256": "64 lowercase hex"
  },
  "publishedAt": "ISO-8601 UTC",
  "githubReleaseUrl": "https://github.com/QiaoKes/fn-music-tv/releases/tag/v1.0.6"
}
```

The App accepts only schema 1, fixed package `com.fnmusic.tv`, HTTPS URLs, positive size/version,
lowercase SHA256, a bounded response, and an APK host equal to the build-fixed manifest host. It has
no GitHub, proxy, or user-configurable fallback.

### Timing, ignore, and lifecycle

- The first visible Activity start checks asynchronously.
- Every successful automatic or manual check schedules the next automatic check at monotonic now +
  12 hours. An automatic failure schedules +30 minutes and stays silent. Timing is process memory.
- Manual checks are unlimited. If an automatic single-flight is active, manual demand joins it and
  upgrades its result/error to manual-visible behavior.
- Ignore records are a device-global `versionCode` set in a dedicated SharedPreferences file, never
  an account preference or Room row. Automatic checks suppress only the exact ignored latest code;
  manual checks still show it with `ignored=true`.
- Automatic prompts move to pending memory while the full-screen Player route is active. Manual
  Settings prompts remain immediate.
- A download exists only while the Activity is foreground. Back, cancel, ordinary background, or
  explicit exit must call `Call.cancel()` promptly, including while a blocking response read is in
  progress, and delete both `.part` and any transient `.apk`. Only an explicit permission/installer
  handoff may retain the verified APK temporarily.

### Verification and installation

Before handing an APK to AppUpdate's `ApkUtil.installApk`, require exact byte count and SHA256,
archive package `com.fnmusic.tv`, candidate `versionCode` equal to the manifest and above the
installed version, and equal non-empty installed/candidate signer digest sets. Empty signer sets are
a verification failure, not a match. Missing unknown-source permission opens only the current
package's settings page. If the user returns without granting permission, delete the verified APK
and require a new download.

The sideload flavor uses AppUpdate only for its `FileProvider + ACTION_VIEW` handoff to the
system-owned package installer. Its downloader, service, notification flow, and dialog activity are
forbidden because they bypass this project's TLS, redirect, size, SHA256, package, version, and
signer authorization boundary. The provider authority is `${applicationId}.fileProvider`, and its
paths resource grants only internal `cacheDir/updates/`. The store flavor uses AppUpdate's no-op
artifact and contains no install permission or AppUpdate component. Returning from the system
installer without app replacement is treated as cancellation/incompletion: delete the candidate and
require a new download. There is no silent install or manufacturer-private API.

Release signing must explicitly enable both v1 (JAR) and v2 APK signatures. Vidda firmware can fail
to open a v2-only APK without surfacing an installer error, even though modern Android accepts it.
This compatibility requirement is independent of `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` and AppUpdate: it also
applies when the user opens the APK from a file manager. Because the App's minSdk is 29, CI must run
`apksigner verify --min-sdk-version 21 --verbose` when asserting v1; the default verification mode
may skip/report v1 as unused even when the JAR signature is present.

### R2 publish ordering and retention

```text
releases/<versionCode>/<apk-file>  # immutable, one-year cache
manifests/<versionCode>.json       # immutable snapshot
update.json                        # public pointer, no-store, conditional write
.publisher/*                       # private management state/history
```

Upload and integrity-check the immutable APK before writing `update.json`. Write `update.json` with
the observed ETag so concurrent publishers cannot overwrite each other. Track the historical highest
`versionCode`; a retry of the exact live version/hash is idempotent and repairs missing highest/history
bookkeeping. Rollback conditionally restores the previous manifest but never deletes objects and never
lowers the historical maximum.

Mutating publisher endpoints require same-origin, JSON, and double-submit CSRF validation. Cloudflare
Access protects both static assets and `/api/*`; the UI must not request Cloudflare/R2 tokens.

Production GitHub requests use the optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` Worker Secret as `Authorization: Bearer`.
The production deployment requires a fine-grained PAT limited to `QiaoKes/fn-music-tv` with only
`Contents: Read-only` (and GitHub's required `Metadata: Read-only`). Never place the PAT in R2,
publisher configuration, browser JavaScript, source control, command arguments, or logs. Anonymous
access remains a local/fail-closed fallback only: Cloudflare Workers can share an egress IP, so
GitHub's unauthenticated per-IP limit is not reliable even for a single administrator.

## 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
|---|---|
| sideload Release URL missing, non-HTTPS, credentialed, or fragmented | fail the Release build; the `-PallowUnsignedRelease=true` local verification opt-in skips this check |
| store flavor | updater disabled; no install permission, provider, service, activity, or receiver in merged manifest |
| manifest too large, unknown schema, wrong package, bad SHA/size/time | reject as check failure |
| APK host differs from manifest host or redirect occurs | reject; never follow to fallback host |
| latest `versionCode` is current/older | automatic idle; manual “already latest” |
| exact latest code is ignored | automatic idle; manual available with ignored badge |
| file count/hash/package/version/signer mismatch | delete file; do not open installer |
| download cancellation/background | close call and delete partial/final transient file |
| unknown-source permission denied/cancelled | delete verified APK; show retryable error and require a new download |
| release APK lacks either v1 or v2 signature | fail CI; do not publish the APK |
| GitHub Release draft | never publish |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` missing/expired/revoked or GitHub rate limit exhausted | show the safe reset/retry error; do not mutate R2 |
| prerelease | hidden by default; explicit visibility and extra confirmation required |
| missing/ambiguous metadata or APK asset | preflight fails without R2 mutation |
| R2 immutable key exists with different content | reject publication |
| new code is not above historical maximum | reject unless exact idempotent live retry |
| ETag conflict on `update.json` | report conflict; do not report success |

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: automatic code 22 was ignored, code 23 is later published, and the App prompts for 23.
- Good: a manual check joins an in-flight automatic request and still displays an ignored release or
  a retryable error.
- Good: APK upload succeeds, immutable snapshot is written, and only then the conditional public
  pointer changes.
- Good: a response is lost after publishing; retrying the same request/version/hash returns success
  and repairs management history without duplicating or overwriting the APK.
- Base: R2 is temporarily unavailable; automatic checks remain silent and retry after 30 minutes,
  while manual checks explain failure without blocking music playback.
- Base: the GitHub PAT expires or is revoked; Release listing/preflight fails visibly while existing
  `update.json` and APKs remain unaffected.
- Base: the user cancels Android's install page; the candidate APK is removed and a later attempt
  starts from a new download.
- Bad: reading GitHub Releases directly from the App, adding `ghfast` fallback, persisting the 12-hour
  timer, or treating `versionName` as version ordering.
- Bad: placing update ignore codes in account-bound `AppPreferences`, using DownloadManager/background
  service, accepting a checksum-only APK without signer comparison, or bypassing system confirmation.
- Bad: exposing `.publisher/*`, Cloudflare tokens, or R2 credentials through the admin form.
- Bad: storing `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `.publisher/config.json`, the UI, `wrangler.jsonc`, or repository
  secrets intended for GitHub Actions instead of a Cloudflare Worker Secret.

## 6. Tests Required

- Contract tests: valid schema, unknown schema, wrong package, insecure/cross-host URL, uppercase/bad
  digest, invalid time/size/version, and oversized body.
- MockWebServer tests: HTTPS manifest success, redirect rejection, byte-count/hash mismatch, and a
  throttled blocking read whose cancellation closes the call and removes both `.part` and `.apk`.
- Preferences/coordinator tests: exact ignored code, higher-code prompt, cleanup below installed code,
  startup/+12h/+30m transitions, manual joining auto, silent automatic error, player pending prompt,
  and foreground-only download.
- APK tests: archive package/version and signer set match/mismatch helpers, including two empty signer
  sets being rejected. Installer/coordinator tests cover dynamic provider authority, unknown-source
  denied/allowed, launch failure, and system-installer return cleanup. Device/emulator coverage must
  exercise system confirm/cancel.
- Compose tests: about copy/version source, removed helper wording, default update focus, three unique
  callbacks, ignored badge, progress percentage/cancel, and focus neighbors.
- Flavor/build checks: sideload and store compile/assemble/lint/unit tests. The sideload merged
  manifest must keep the permission and narrow non-exported AppUpdate provider while excluding the
  unused AppUpdate service/activity and legacy receiver. The store merged manifest must contain none
  of those install capabilities.
- Release artifact checks: verify the official package/certificate plus v1 and v2 signatures;
  validate v1 with an explicit compatibility minimum SDK rather than the APK's declared minSdk.
- CI metadata script: deterministic fixture verifies file name, size, lowercase hashes, signer, version,
  commit, and invalid-input rejection.
- Worker tests with local R2: stable/prerelease/draft filters, metadata mismatch, immutable write,
  conditional pointer conflict, highest-code enforcement, idempotent repair, rollback, CSRF, typecheck,
  and dry-run deploy build.
- GitHub client tests: when `GITHUB_TOKEN` exists, every list/detail/metadata/APK request carries a
  Bearer header; the token never appears in a URL or returned error. Production smoke checks must list
  and preflight a Release after the Secret-bearing Worker version receives traffic.

Hardware installation and production Cloudflare/R2 smoke tests are rollout checks; lack of a connected
device or deployment credentials must be recorded rather than silently claimed as passed.

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

```kotlin
// Wrong: account-scoped ignore and a background downloader outlive the visible App.
appPreferences.bindNamespace(userGuid)
DownloadManager.enqueue(request)

// Correct: device-global exact codes plus a visible-lifecycle coordinator.
UpdatePreferences(application).ignore(manifest.versionCode)
updateCoordinator.onBackground(changingConfigurations = false) // cancels active download
```

```typescript
// Wrong: publish the pointer first or overwrite a versioned APK key.
await bucket.put("update.json", manifest);
await bucket.put("releases/latest.apk", apk);

// Correct: immutable content first, then an ETag-conditional public pointer.
await repository.putImmutableApk(apkKey, response, size, sha256);
await repository.saveVersionManifest(manifest);
await repository.publishManifest(manifest, current?.etag ?? null);
```

```typescript
// Wrong: expose a credential through the persisted publisher configuration.
await repository.saveConfig({ ...config, githubToken });

// Correct: inject a least-privilege Worker Secret only at the GitHub boundary.
const github = new GithubClient(fetch, env.GITHUB_TOKEN);
```

```kotlin
// Wrong: checksum and display name alone authorize installation.
if (sha256 == manifest.sha256) installer.install(apk)

// Correct: verify every Android replacement boundary before system confirmation.
require(candidate.packageName == "com.fnmusic.tv")
require(candidate.longVersionCode == manifest.versionCode && candidate.longVersionCode > installed.longVersionCode)
require(signerDigests(candidate).isNotEmpty())
require(signerDigests(installed).isNotEmpty())
require(signerDigests(candidate) == signerDigests(installed))
installer.install(apk) // AppUpdate opens Android's system-owned confirmation UI.
```
