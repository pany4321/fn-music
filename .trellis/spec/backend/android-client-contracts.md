# Android Client Data, Playback, and CI Contracts

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract for changes crossing the NAS API, session repository, process response cache,
artwork cache, Room store, application playback runtime, Media3 service, native decoder packaging,
current-presentation pipeline, or build pipeline. These boundaries own credentials, namespace
isolation, persisted schemas, playback authorization, codec compatibility, current-track identity,
and distributable APKs, so changes require contract-level tests.

Room uses `AppDatabase` version 3 and exports JSON schemas. `MIGRATION_1_2` adds non-null
`account_state.schemaRevision INTEGER DEFAULT 1`; `MIGRATION_2_3` adds
`account_state.onlineLyricsMatchingEnabled INTEGER DEFAULT 1` and the independent
`cache_matched_lyric` table. The only Media3 custom commands are
`ConfigureAuth`, `ClearAuth`, and `SetShuffleOrder`; there is no media `ClearCache` command.
Command failures use `SessionError` codes, not removed `SessionResult.RESULT_ERROR_*` constants.

## 3. Contracts

### NAS and session

- Accepted server schemes are HTTP and HTTPS only. Reject credentials, queries, fragments, empty
  hosts, and other schemes before any request.
- Arbitrary user-supplied HTTP NAS origins require cleartext traffic in the application network
  security config. The login UI must keep the visible unencrypted-connection warning whenever HTTP
  is selected; never silently downgrade an HTTPS input.
- Canonical API base ends in `/music/api/v1/`; an explicit scheme also updates the HTTPS toggle.
- A bare host or IP without an explicit port follows the NAS service convention: `5666` with the
  HTTP toggle, `5667` with the HTTPS toggle. Explicit `http://` uses standard port `80`, explicit
  `https://` uses standard port `443`. Explicit ports are always preserved.
- TLS hostname verification accepts raw-IP literal targets while still requiring a system-trusted
  certificate chain (`NasHostnameVerifier` on the OkHttp client plus the process-wide
  `HttpsURLConnection` default that covers Media3 streams); domain targets verify strictly. This is
  also what lets FNID probing select `https://<ip>:5667` candidates.
  `editableInput` displays only the host when the canonical URL uses its implicit port and
  the standard music API path; custom ports remain visible.
- A six-or-more-character alphanumeric/underscore/hyphen identifier with no URL punctuation is an
  FNID. Resolve it through the signed FN Connect lookup, then concurrently probe internal IPv4,
  public IPv6, public IPv4, and HTTPS relay candidates in that priority order. IP candidates try
  HTTP before HTTPS; relay requests carry `Cookie: mode=relay`.
- FN Connect signing configuration enters Release builds only through the paired
  `FN_CONNECT_AUTHX_PREFIX` and `FN_CONNECT_API_KEY` environment variables. A non-cacheable Gradle
  task emits randomized encrypted byte payloads below `core/data/build/generated`; tracked source,
  Android resources, manifests, `BuildConfig` strings, workflow arguments, and logs never contain
  the plaintext values. Debug and test compilation may use an explicitly unconfigured generated
  provider, while Release compilation fails closed when either variable is absent — except the
  `-PallowUnsignedRelease=true` local verification opt-in, which runs the unconfigured provider
  (`isConfigured=false`, FNID lookup fails closed at runtime).
- The generated decoder is static-analysis resistance, not a trust boundary: it reconstructs
  temporary byte arrays only for the existing MD5 request-signing input, and the signer clears those
  arrays in `finally`. The request path, nonce range, millisecond timestamp, body digest, separators,
  and `authx` header format remain byte-for-byte compatible with the upstream protocol.
- Probe `/access_code_verify` at the origin before the music API. Encode a supplied security code
  once as base64 UTF-8 and attach `x-access-code` plus `x-access-source: app` to login,
  authenticated API, artwork, and Media3 audio requests. Security codes are zero-filled at the UI
  boundary and, only with remember-login, encrypted by Android Keystore storage.
- A manually entered password reaches the repository as `CharArray`, is hashed once, and is
  zero-filled in `finally`. Only its strictly validated 64-character lowercase SHA-256 hex value
  may be persisted; because that digest is replayable by the NAS login API, it has the same storage
  sensitivity as a password and must remain inside the Keystore-backed encrypted payload.
- Password login includes the stable installation `deviceId`. Authenticated API and playback HTTP
  use the returned token as the raw `Authorization` value, without a `Bearer` prefix.
- `remember=true` upserts one encrypted login profile keyed by canonical server plus case-sensitive
  username. The profile contains server/relay mode, username, password digest, optional security
  code, token, and last-used time; retain at most five profiles in descending last-used order.
  `remember=false` keeps the new login in memory and removes a matching persisted profile.
- Profile selection calls `loginWithHistory(profileId)` immediately. The UI receives only display
  metadata and `hasSavedPassword`; it must never receive or render the digest. Deleting one profile
  or clearing history removes its encrypted credentials without terminating a currently signed-in
  in-memory session.
- `SessionRepository` construction performs no token or access-code decryption. `restore()` loads
  remembered credentials once on `Dispatchers.IO` while `SessionState.Loading` remains published;
  login and invalidation then own the in-memory values. Application/container construction must
  never call Android Keystore reads on the main thread.
- API code `120001`/`99999` maps to `Unauthenticated`; `120002` maps to `AccountDisabled`;
  `100005` maps to `NotFound`.
- API clients keep automatic redirects and OkHttp transport retries disabled. Relay requests may
  manually follow at most five redirects while preserving relay, access-code, and auth headers.
  Their network interceptor adds
  `Connection: close` only to HTTP/1.1 requests so a FNOS nginx idle timeout cannot leave a stale
  pooled socket for the next logical request. HTTP/2 and Media3 audio streaming are unaffected.
- `SessionRepository.restore()` contains server discovery, `me()`, saved-digest fallback login,
  user mapping, and signed-in publication in one exception boundary. Cancellation is always
  rethrown. An invalid token is cleared and falls back once to the same profile's saved digest;
  terminal credential/access/account errors publish signed-out state. Retryable transport,
  HTTP 408/429/5xx, or temporarily unavailable-network failures retain every credential and publish
  `Recovering` while retrying after 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, then capped 30 second delays. The
  application-scoped `NetworkRestoreMonitor` additionally restarts recovery immediately whenever
  the system reports a usable network; only a `Recovering` session may restart — signed-in,
  signed-out, and loading states ignore the callback. The monitor request requires
  `NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET` but not `VALIDATED`, so a captive portal still gets one probe attempt.
- The application requests `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` once at startup on API 33+ through the Activity
  Result API. Denial is ignored: playback and login stay fully functional; only the system media
  notification entry is lost.
- User-token invalidation clears auth and returns to login. HLS or roam-session invalidation must
  not clear the user token.

### Server-backed favorites

- Favorites use `POST favorite-track/create`, `POST favorite-track/delete`, and
  `GET favorite-track/list?page=<page>&size=50&sort=favoriteAt,desc`. Both POST bodies are exactly
  `{ "trackGUID": "<guid>" }`; a success envelope may contain `data: null` and must be decoded as
  a Unit response rather than requiring a JSON payload.
- `TrackDto.isFavorite` maps into `Track.isFavorite`. Metadata, ordinary track pages, roam results,
  and favorite pages seed one account-scoped `FavoriteLibraryState` keyed by track GUID. A namespace
  change or sign-out clears it before the next account can observe any value.
- The NAS is the source of truth. Favorite list pages bypass the persistent response cache and use
  server paging, so another device's changes are visible on reload. No favorite is persisted in
  Room or preferences as authoritative state.
- Toggle publishes one optimistic desired value under a serialized mutation, calls create/delete,
  increments `revision` only after success, and removes the pending marker. Failure or cancellation
  restores the last server-confirmed value; cancellation is rethrown. Every mutation captures its
  originating namespace, and a completion arriving after account change is ignored.
- `QueueSource.Favorites(sort = "favoriteAt,desc")` participates in queue paging and version-2
  snapshot round trips exactly like the other normal queue sources.

### Response, Room, and artwork cache

- Every cache key and persisted record is namespaced by `serverGuid:userGuid`. The process response
  key is exactly `(namespace, kind, businessKey, page)`; a business key without a namespace is
  invalid.
- `MusicRepository` retains at most 8 MiB of validated serialized UTF-8 response payloads in an
  access-ordered process-lifetime LRU. Retained entries have no TTL. Eviction, explicit clear,
  or process death permits a later NAS request.
- Read order is process memory, join/start the keyed in-flight request, NAS, then memory plus
  best-effort Room persistence. A `NetworkUnavailable` NAS result may fall back to a valid Room
  page/index/lyric payload and seed the process cache. Stateful roam requests never enter this
  cache.
- Concurrent misses for one `ResponseCacheKey` share one repository-owned upstream request. Each
  caller is a waiter: canceling one waiter does not cancel another, but detaching the final waiter
  cancels the upstream job and its OkHttp call. Failures, invalid payloads, and canceled results are
  never retained.
- Namespace and global invalidation increment generations, remove matching retained entries, and
  cancel matching in-flight work. A result captured before invalidation, or with no remaining
  waiter, must fail acceptance and cannot persist to Room or re-enter memory.
- Essential account state and evictable page/lyric/index payloads remain separate. Evict payloads
  at a 24 MiB target and cap physical DB + WAL + SHM at 32 MiB. Namespace clearing checkpoints WAL
  and runs incremental vacuum; cache-only clearing preserves `account_state`.
- `LocalStore` performs one exact payload/physical audit when its process-local estimate is absent.
  Subsequent writes add the encoded payload size conservatively and trigger another exact audit only
  when the 24 MiB payload estimate, 32 MiB physical estimate, 4 MiB unverified growth, or 32-write
  interval is reached. `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` plus incremental vacuum runs only after actual
  eviction or explicit clear, never after an ordinary under-budget save.
- First-party FN lyrics use `cache_lyric`; selected third-party matches use
  `cache_matched_lyric`. Both are namespace-scoped, contribute to the same payload budget, and are
  removed by namespace/all-evictable clearing. Disabling online matching bypasses the matched table
  without deleting it. Negative matched-lyric entries use their encoded expiry as the exact process-
  cache validity boundary; an expired retained entry is removed and may rematch immediately.
- Every Room schema change increments the database version, exports its JSON schema, supplies a
  lossless migration, and preserves queue/settings/account namespaces. Destructive migration is
  forbidden.
- Artwork uses a 24 MiB access-ordered encoded-byte memory LRU plus `cacheDir/artwork`. Its key is
  `(namespace, coverId, variant)`, files live below a hashed namespace directory, and same-key cold
  misses use the same waiter-aware single-flight and generation rules as response payloads.
- `AppContainer` additionally owns one 40 MiB access-ordered decoded-`Bitmap` LRU keyed by the exact
  `(coverId, CoverVariant)`. Compact, Grid, Player, and Poster are independent entries. Same-key
  consumers join one application-scoped decode, at most three loads run concurrently, and a
  composable cancellation does not cancel work still useful to another consumer.
- Decoded cache clearing increments a generation, cancels known in-flight work, and rejects every
  result captured before the clear. Clear it whenever the authenticated namespace changes or signs
  out and alongside explicit artwork/all-cache clearing; this is what makes its non-namespaced key
  account-safe. Decoded bytes are process-only and are excluded from disk-cache usage reporting.
- Validate downloaded and disk-read image bytes before acceptance. Invalid disk entries are
  deleted; invalid, failed, or canceled downloads leave neither a final file nor a negative cache
  entry. A later request remains eligible to retry.
- Write artwork to a temporary file and replace the target only after validation, using atomic move
  where supported. Touch the final file on both memory and disk hits. Disk pruning is global across
  all namespace directories, ordered by last access, and uses the selected device-wide
  32/64/128/256 MiB budget; the default is 128 MiB.
- Artwork initialization purges unattributable legacy flat files and stale temporary files, then
  enforces the global budget off the main thread. Changing account must not multiply the budget.
- Artwork initialization or a missing ledger performs one full-tree calibration. Thereafter every
  successful replace/delete adjusts a `diskMutex`-owned byte ledger; an under-budget write must not
  walk or sort the tree. Full LRU scan/sort remains required when the ledger crosses the selected
  budget, when the user applies a lower budget, or when error recovery invalidates the ledger.
- A network or validated Room fallback DTO decoded during one repository call is reused for
  persistence metadata and the returned domain projection. Process-cache hits from another call
  still decode their serialized payload once; serialized cache and Room formats do not change.
- `invalidateNamespace(namespace, includeEssential=false)` clears that namespace's response memory,
  in-flight work, artwork memory/files, and evictable Room rows while preserving its account row.
  Logout/auth invalidation may pass `includeEssential=true`. `clearAllEvictableCaches()` invalidates
  all response generations, clears all artwork namespaces, and clears evictable Room rows while
  preserving credentials and essential account records.
- Cache settings and usage describe only global artwork bytes plus Room/index bytes. They never
  report audio bytes.

### Online lyric selection and presentation

- `core:lyrics` uses Accompanist Lyrics Core as the only runtime lyric model and parser registry.
  Parser order is QQ `QqQrcParser`, `NeteaseYrcParser`, `KugouKrcParser`, then
  `EnhancedLrcParser`; the project owns only the narrow QRC parser because the SDK does not provide
  one. Do not add a second LRC/YRC/KRC parser, timeline model, or app-layer conversion.
- Provider order is Netease, QQ Music, then Kugou. Prefer each provider's native word format
  (`yrc`, `qrc`, `krc`) and retain that provider's LRC endpoint only as a transport fallback.
  Decryption/decompression is provider transport work; parsed output is always `SyncedLyrics`.
- Metadata eligibility remains a hard gate. Search every enabled provider concurrently, keep each
  search/fetch bounded by its source timeout, and wait for all provider terminal outcomes. A global
  deadline or early aggregation window must not let the first plain result suppress a later richer
  result.
- Fetch at most three metadata-ranked candidates per provider and rank every usable fetched result.
  The deterministic content tuple is: any translation first, translation coverage second, eligible
  word timing third, known duration delta ascending fourth, provider order fifth, and remote ID
  last. Metadata scoring remains the pre-fetch eligibility gate; it does not override the fetched
  content tuple. Phonetic/romanized text never raises the quality tier.
- Word timing is eligible only when both local and provider durations are known, positive, and their
  absolute difference is at most 2,000 ms. Unknown duration or a delta above 2,000 ms converts the
  candidate to SDK `SyncedLine` values while preserving line timing and translation. Line-timed
  candidates require a known delta of at most 5,000 ms when both durations are available; reject a
  known larger delta and never display syllable highlighting that cannot be trusted to align.
- Fall back to first-party FN lyrics only after online matching returns no usable result or a
  terminal online failure. Disabling online matching bypasses every third-party call and goes
  directly to FN lyrics. Caller cancellation is always rethrown and must not trigger fallback.
- `MatchedLyricsEnvelope.schemaVersion` is a required, explicitly serialized integer. The metadata
  fingerprint also includes `MATCH_PROTOCOL_VERSION`; change both when selection or projection
  semantics change. A missing, old, or mismatched version is a cache miss, including old positive
  and negative rows.
- Preserve SDK syllable start/end times and separate translation/phonetic fields through
  `core:lyrics -> core:data -> app`. Persistence may use a private serializable DTO only at the
  Room cache boundary and must restore the same `SyncedLine`/`KaraokeLine` semantics. There is no
  public project-owned lyric timeline model.
- Remove kana-only Japanese source readings in ASCII or full-width parentheses before display,
  including annotations split across YRC syllables. Preserve ordinary Chinese/English parenthetical
  content and keep phonetic sidecars available in the model while hiding them in the TV player.
- TV lyric views use Accompanist Lyrics UI's `KaraokeLyricsView` for multi-line auto-scroll and word
  highlighting. Both player styles show translations, hide phonetic rows, use compact typography,
  disable blur, and keep the lyric surface out of the remote focus graph.
- The app minimum SDK is API 23. The Android-only lyrics UI and Gaze Capsule sources are vendored
  under `third_party/` at pinned upstream revisions and must remain local project dependencies;
  do not reintroduce the published artifacts whose manifests require newer Android versions.

### Playback, snapshot, and current presentation

- `core:playback` owns the narrow `PlaybackSessionStore` and `PlaybackContentSource` capability
  contracts and must not depend on `core:data`. The app composition root adapts `LocalStore` and
  `MusicRepository`; adapters are stateless parameter mappings and cannot add cache semantics.
- Media3 failures are projected as `PlaybackFailure`. Session verification is selected by the
  numeric Media3 error code (`ERROR_CODE_IO_BAD_HTTP_STATUS`), never by parsing `errorCodeName`.
- `AuthenticatedAppCoordinator` is the sole owner of signed-in session orchestration: namespace
  binding, invalid-auth playback/cache cleanup, account switch, cache clear, and explicit exit.
  Account switch preserves playback clear -> artwork clear -> local namespace clear -> logout;
  the local clear removes evictable rows with `includeEssential=false` so per-account preferences
  survive a later return to that account. Invalid-auth cleanup may still remove essential account
  state. The existing best-effort playback-clear boundary remains non-blocking for later cleanup.
- `PlaybackService` constructs `DefaultMediaSourceFactory` directly from an authenticated
  `DefaultHttpDataSource.Factory`. Persistent audio cache classes (`SimpleCache`,
  `CacheDataSource`, cache-key factories, download stores) are forbidden.
- API 23+ FLAC support comes from the checked-in official Media3 1.10.1 decoder extension built
  with libFLAC 1.5.0. The app module packages the local AAR because `core:playback` is itself an
  Android library; `core:playback` owns only `DefaultRenderersFactory` configuration. Do not add a
  direct local-AAR dependency to an Android library or mix Media3 extension versions.
- `createPlaybackRenderersFactory` uses `EXTENSION_RENDERER_MODE_PREFER`, so libFLAC wins even when
  an OEM advertises a silent/broken FLAC `MediaCodec`. The AAR contains no decoder for MP3, AAC,
  WAV, or other formats, so their existing renderer selection remains unchanged.
- `/track/stream?guid=...` is a multi-format, extensionless endpoint. Keep `MediaItem` MIME-neutral
  and let Media3 use response headers plus content sniffing. The FLAC extension may decode during
  extraction and output PCM, so a successful FLAC path does not necessarily emit an audio-decoder
  initialization callback. Never infer `audio/flac` from display metadata or the URL shape.
- Every application build verifies the decoder AAR SHA-256 and requires exactly `arm64-v8a`,
  `armeabi-v7a`, `x86`, and `x86_64` copies of `libflacJNI.so`. Source revisions, NDK/CMake pins,
  licenses, and the rebuild command live beside the artifact. Release shrinking must consume the
  upstream Media3/FLAC consumer rules and retain reflective constructors plus JNI members.
- Forward buffering uses both minimum and maximum `50_000` ms. Back buffering uses `15_000` ms
  with keyframe retention disabled. Cross-protocol redirects remain disabled. The player sets
  `C.WAKE_MODE_LOCAL` so screen-off or CPU-throttled car units keep playing; the foreground
  service notification bounds the wake lock's lifetime.
- Service startup idempotently deletes the legacy `cacheDir/media` tree. Symbolic-link detection
  uses NIO `BasicFileAttributes` read with `NOFOLLOW_LINKS` — never the historical
  canonical-vs-absolute heuristic, which cannot detect symlinks on Windows canonicalization —
  and a detected link is unlinked with `Files.deleteIfExists` without traversing its target.
  No normal playback path recreates it.
- `ConfigureAuth` requires non-blank token and namespace and installs the raw `Authorization`
  header plus optional access-code headers and relay token/mode cookies, and records the signed-in
  api base; `ClearAuth` removes all request properties and the recorded base. Neither command
  changes repository caches.
- Playback transport is driven by the platform media session: `RoutingPlayer` forwards
  play/pause to ExoPlayer and routes next/previous through `PlaybackTransportBridge`, so roam
  playback advances its own window while normal playback keeps the 3-second restart-then-step
  convention for previous. The manifest declares `androidx.media3.session.MediaButtonReceiver`
  for `ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTON` so a steering-wheel or headset key wakes the service after process
  death; the session then serves `onPlaybackResumption` with the persisted queue.
- The service wraps its HTTP data sources in `ResolvingDataSource` with an api-base rewriter
  (`rebaseApiUri`): queued stream URIs carry absolute origins, so after the session re-homes the
  service rewrites same-app `/music/api/v1/` request URIs onto the newest base (path and query
  preserved) without rebuilding the Media3 timeline. Non-http, foreign, and non-API URIs are
  never rewritten.
- `SessionRepository.rehomeConnection()` re-runs server discovery for the signed-in account
  (full FNID probe order through `restoreAttempt`) and rebinds the API connection; on success it
  re-publishes `SignedIn`, and the caller re-applies playback credentials and prepares/plays
  (`PlaybackController.retryAfterConnectionChange`, network-class errors only). Failure returns
  false and leaves the existing binding, state, and credentials untouched.
- `SessionRepository.persistedPlaybackAuth()` exposes the remembered token/access-code/relay
  projection for cold-start media-button resume; it never mutates session state. The service
  serves resumption through `MediaSession.Callback.onPlaybackResumption` (both overloads) from
  the app-provided `PlaybackResumptionProvider`: last-saved namespace (recorded by the session
  store adapter on every snapshot write) + persisted snapshot + persisted auth, decoded through
  the strict version-2 codec and returned as `MediaSession.MediaItemsWithStartPosition`.
- Network-class playback failures (IO unspecified 2000, connection failed 2001, connection
  timeout 2002, timeout 1003) are `isNetworkRetryable` and surface a player retry; other codes
  (bad HTTP status, file not found, decoding, DRM) do not.
- `SetShuffleOrder` requires a non-negative `SnapshotRevision` and a `MediaIds` list that is the
  same size and exact set as the current Media3 queue, with no blank or duplicate IDs on either
  side. Invalid input returns `SessionError.ERROR_BAD_VALUE` without mutating shuffle order.
  Success applies the requested order and echoes the exact revision and ID list in result extras.
- The controller activates shuffle only when the success acknowledgement still matches the pending
  generation, revision, canonical queue, and order. A stale, malformed, rejected, or failed
  acknowledgement falls back to the declared non-shuffle mode and cannot publish a shuffle
  snapshot.
- `removeQueueItem(queueIndex)` accepts only a valid occurrence index in a normal queue. Before the
  Media3 mutation it starts a structural transition and clears `queueSource` plus `queueWindow`, so
  later server paging cannot reinsert the locally removed occurrence. Removing current selects the
  following item, removing the current tail falls back to the previous item, and removing the final
  item stops playback and resets to `ListRepeat`.
- After manual deletion, rebuild the bounded queue projection and persist a structural snapshot. If
  shuffle was active, discard stale pending activation, retain the remaining acknowledged order,
  complete a new order for remaining canonical IDs, and require a fresh exact acknowledgement.
- Playback persistence uses strict version-2 JSON. It stores generation, monotonically increasing
  revision, up to 250 unique media items, current index/position, exact queue source and page
  segments, queue kind, play mode, complete shuffle order, roam cursor/window, at most one frozen
  normal queue, and play/pause intent. Unknown versions/enums, negative fields, duplicate IDs,
  inconsistent segments, incomplete shuffle order, invalid roam cursor, or deeper frozen nesting
  reject the whole snapshot rather than partially restoring it.
- One FIFO, revision-aware writer owns all snapshot writes. Structural transitions expose
  `PlaybackTransition.awaitCommitted()`; navigation, normal-queue replacement, roam exit, and
  logout/auth invalidation wait at their durability boundaries. A late position checkpoint is
  skipped and cannot overwrite a newer queue, mode, roam transition, or clear. A decoded legacy
  snapshot is normalized and immediately rewritten as version 2. Capture Media3 state on its
  owning thread, but encode the immutable snapshot on `Dispatchers.Default` inside that same FIFO
  writer; encoding jobs outside the writer may reorder structural revisions and are forbidden.
- The 250 ms ticker updates only `PlaybackController.progress`. `PlaybackController.state` owns
  stable playback metadata, presentation identity, queue/mode, errors, and transport availability,
  and must not emit for a position-only tick. Queue projection is reused for progress, playback
  state, and error-only events; rebuild it only for timeline, media-item-transition, or media-
  metadata events. Player lyrics and progress controls observe the progress flow in their own
  composition scopes so Home/My/root and the queue overlay are not invalidated at 4 Hz.
- Playback controller and `NowPlayingPresenter` are application-scoped and start exactly once from
  `Application.onCreate`; Activity recreation or returning to desktop must not create a second
  runtime or discard the active queue. A signed-in namespace binds preferences, artwork budget,
  playback credentials, and restore. Invalid auth durably clears playback before invalidating the
  departing namespace.
- Explicit app exit is distinct from auth/session clearing: cancel in-flight queue/roam work, pause
  playback, durably persist the current queue and position with pause intent, stop and release the
  player/controller, then stop the playback service. Login, preferences, and repository caches are
  retained for the next launch.
- Current-track fields are captured from one `currentMediaItem.mediaMetadata` instance. A real item
  transition, or a material change to its ID/title/artist/format/cover, increments
  `presentationRevision`. The complete presentation identity is
  `(namespace, mediaId, presentationRevision)`; `mediaId` alone is not sufficient.
- `MEDIA_ITEM_TRANSITION_REASON_PLAYLIST_CHANGED` does not unconditionally force another
  presentation revision: queue installation and metadata enrichment already project their material
  field change, and the following Media3 callback must not cancel and restart the same artwork/lyric
  requests. Seek/auto/repeat transitions still force a revision; playlist changes rely on the
  captured presentation-key comparison and only publish when those fields actually differ.
- A new presentation identity immediately publishes resource `Loading` states and cancels the old
  presentation/retry jobs. Metadata, artwork, and lyrics may complete independently, but only the
  current identity token and player style may update UI state. Late A -> B -> A completions from an
  older revision are rejected. Missing `coverId` is enriched from matching full-track metadata
  without delaying audio playback.
- OkHttp calls use cancellable async execution: coroutine cancellation invokes `Call.cancel()` and
  `CancellationException` is rethrown through API, retry, and cache boundaries. Cancellation never
  becomes a cached value or a retryable UI failure. Canceling a stale presenter job publishes
  nothing; an independently canceled request whose identity is still current settles to the
  terminal metadata fallback or resource `Absent` state without a retry action.
- Current metadata, artwork, and lyrics retry only retryable idempotent request failures, after
  `250` ms and `750` ms, for at most three total attempts. I/O, HTTP `408`, `429`, and `5xx` are
  retryable. HTTP `401`, `404`, redirects, other `4xx`, invalid/empty content, envelope errors, and
  cancellation are terminal and receive one attempt.
- Current artwork/lyrics `404` or successful empty content maps to `Absent`. Current metadata
  `404`/empty keeps the captured MediaItem title, artist, format, and cover as `Ready` fallback.
  Exhausted transient failures expose `RetryableFailure`; manual retry targets only failed assets
  for the unchanged current presentation identity.

### CI

- The application applies the Baseline Profile consumer plugin and connects the
  `:baselineprofile` generator through its `baselineProfile` dependency. Release builds keep
  automatic device generation disabled, consume the checked-in app profile, and merge rules for
  the application's own startup, session, authenticated UI, and playback classes. The generator's
  login/home/collection/player journeys remain the source for device-based refreshes.
- `version.properties` is the single source of application versioning. The first formal package is
  `VERSION_NAME=0.1.0` with monotonic `VERSION_CODE=2`, which is higher than the previous development
  package. Every later distributable must increase `VERSION_CODE`; display version changes alone do
  not make an Android upgrade.
- Local Release APK packaging fails closed unless the fixed `fn-music-tv` signing identity is
  available from the default protected directory, Gradle properties, or
  `FN_MUSIC_RELEASE_PASSWORD`; signed sideload packaging additionally requires the HTTPS
  `fnMusicUpdateManifestUrl`. Keystores and passwords never enter Git. Any machine — developer
  workstation or CI — may opt into local verification Release builds only with explicit
  `-PallowUnsignedRelease=true`: the update-manifest check and the FN Connect release-configuration
  check are skipped, and the release build type falls back to the debug keystore so the APK
  installs for device testing. Those artifacts use a non-official signer (they cannot update an
  official installation and FNID lookup fails closed at runtime) and must never be distributed as
  formal updates.
- Media3 unstable APIs require `androidx.annotation.OptIn(UnstableApi::class)` at the implementation
  boundary so lint accepts usage without making callers opt in.
- CI has one packaging responsibility: on `main`, restore the fixed signing identity from protected
  repository secrets, read connection-signing values from the branch-restricted `release`
  environment, build the signed sideload Release APK without Gradle caching, and verify package, version, signer,
  minimum/target SDK, and all four supported ABIs. Upload exactly one universal APK plus its SHA-256
  checksum as a 14-day workflow artifact. Unit tests, lint, store/test APKs, and benchmark variants
  remain explicit local gates rather than CI packaging work.
- If `v<VERSION_NAME>` has not been published, the same packaging job creates the immutable tag and
  GitHub Release after verification. The GitHub Release title is the exact `v<VERSION_NAME>` tag;
  do not prefix it with the product name. An already-published version is rebuilt as a workflow
  artifact without overwriting its release. Lint ignores `OldTargetApi` because the project target
  is pinned while that check varies with the newest platform installed in the environment.
- `baselineprofile` resolves the app's `distribution` dimension to `sideload`.

## 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Caller cancels lyric matching | Rethrow `CancellationException`; cancel children and do not request FN lyrics |
| I/O, HTTP 408/429/5xx | `NetworkUnavailable`, retryable; current resources make at most 3 total attempts |
| Redirect or other non-success HTTP status | `NetworkUnavailable`, terminal, one attempt |
| Envelope code 0 with missing required data | `Empty`, terminal; nullable/current resource becomes `Absent` where allowed |
| Invalid/corrupt JSON or invalid image bytes | `Unknown("invalid_json")` or `Absent`; never cache, never automatically retry |

| Namespace/global clear during a miss | Increment generation, cancel matching flight, reject every late write |
| Retained response cache hit | Return serialized payload with no NAS call and update process LRU order |
| Response cache exceeds 8 MiB | Evict least-recently-used UTF-8 payloads until within capacity |
| Artwork memory/disk hit | Return bytes with no cover HTTP call and touch the disk entry |
| Exact decoded bitmap hit | Return it synchronously on the first composition; do not show a placeholder frame |
| Only another artwork variant is decoded | Treat as a miss; keep the stable placeholder and load the exact variant |
| Decoded cache clear races an older load | Cancel the flight and reject its result by generation; memory stays empty |
| Artwork disk budget exceeded | Evict globally least-recently-used files across all namespaces |
| Artwork write remains within the tracked budget | Adjust the byte ledger; do not walk or sort the cache tree |
| Artwork process starts or ledger is invalidated | Calibrate from disk once, purge legacy/temp files, then enforce the budget |
| Ordinary Room cache write stays below all audit thresholds | Update conservative estimates; do not run SUM/checkpoint/vacuum |
| Room estimate crosses a target or audit interval | Run exact payload/physical queries; evict if needed and reclaim only after removal |
| SessionRepository is constructed | Publish Loading with zero secure-store reads |
| Session restore needs remembered credentials | Read the versioned encrypted profile payload and legacy token/access code once on `Dispatchers.IO` |
| Encrypted session payload is malformed or has an unknown version | Publish a generic recoverable signed-out error; never overwrite the ciphertext |
| History reaches a sixth server/account profile | Evict the least-recently-used profile and all of its encrypted credentials |

| Bare host or IP, HTTP toggle | Add port `5666` and `/music/api/v1/` |
| Bare host or IP, HTTPS toggle | Add port `5667` and `/music/api/v1/`; explicit `https://` keeps `443` |

| ConfigureAuth has blank token/namespace | `SessionError.ERROR_BAD_VALUE` |
| SetShuffleOrder has negative revision or non-exact IDs | `SessionError.ERROR_BAD_VALUE`; do not apply shuffle |
| Valid SetShuffleOrder | Success; echo exact `SnapshotRevision` and `MediaIds` acknowledgement |
| Playback fails with a network-class code | Surface `isNetworkRetryable`; the retry re-homes the session, re-applies credentials, and prepares/plays |
| Playback fails with a non-network code (401, 404, decode, DRM) | No playback retry; existing typed-failure behavior applies |
| Session re-homes while a queue was installed against the old origin | The service rebases same-app API URIs onto the new base at open time; timeline is unchanged |
| Re-home finds no reachable candidate | Return false; state, credentials, and current binding stay untouched |
| Media play button arrives after process death | `MediaButtonReceiver` starts the service, then `onPlaybackResumption` returns the persisted snapshot plus remembered auth; with nothing persisted it reports unresumable |
| Media play/pause, next, or previous arrives during playback | The media session applies it; next/previous route through the roam-aware transport bridge |
| Media previous within 3 seconds of the current track | Step to the previous track |
| Media previous after 3 seconds | Restart the current track from the beginning |
| Server input contains full-width punctuation or alphanumerics | `normalizeWide` converts them before validation; FNID detection applies the same fold |
| Login address fails validation | The login form shows `NAS 地址格式不正确`; the submit control stays disabled |
| Shuffle acknowledgement is stale or no longer matches the queue | Controller ignores it and applies the declared fallback mode |
| Invalid or roam queue deletion index | Return `null`; do not mutate Media3 or persist a transition |
| Current queue item is deleted | Select the next occurrence, or previous when deleting the tail |
| Final queue item is deleted | Stop, clear the queue, reset ListRepeat, and persist the empty snapshot |
| Unknown MediaSession command | `SessionError.ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` |
| Playback snapshot violates any version-2 invariant | Reject the entire snapshot; do not partially restore |
| Position-only ticker update | Publish `PlaybackProgressState`; do not emit `PlaybackUiState` or rebuild queue items |
| Timeline, media-item, or media-metadata event | Rebuild the bounded queue projection and publish stable playback state |
| Captured snapshot is ready to persist | Enqueue it first, then encode on the writer's background dispatcher in FIFO order |
| Media3 failure is `ERROR_CODE_IO_BAD_HTTP_STATUS` | Publish typed failure and ask the coordinator to verify the session |
| Other Media3 failure | Publish typed failure for display; do not verify the session |
| Account switch is activated | Clear playback, artwork, local namespace, then logout through the coordinator |
| Legacy `cacheDir/media` exists at service startup | Delete safely; continue with direct HTTP and do not recreate it |
| Legacy `cacheDir/media` is a symbolic link | Detect via `NOFOLLOW_LINKS` attributes and unlink only the entry on every platform |
| `Recovering` session and the system reports a network | Restart recovery immediately; SignedIn/SignedOut/Loading ignore the callback |
| ExoPlayer is built for the service | `WAKE_MODE_LOCAL` is set alongside audio attributes and noisy-stream handling |
| FLAC stream on API 23+ | Load bundled `libflacJNI`, prefer the Media3 FLAC extension, and decode to PCM |
| Extensionless `/track/stream` returns a non-FLAC format | Content-detect it normally; do not apply a forced FLAC MIME |
| FLAC AAR checksum differs from its sidecar | Fail `verifyFlacDecoderArtifact` before application packaging |
| FLAC AAR has a missing or extra ABI | Fail `verifyFlacDecoderArtifact`; do not emit a partial universal APK |
| Native library cannot load or FLAC playback errors | Surface the normal Media3 playback failure; never report silent success |
| DB payload or physical budget exceeded | LRU batch eviction, checkpoint, incremental vacuum |
| CI produces no APK | Artifact upload fails the job |
| Release merged art profile contains no `Lcom/fnmusic/tv` rule | Profile wiring is incomplete; fail performance acceptance |
| Release packaging has no fixed key/password and no `allowUnsignedRelease=true` | Fail before packaging; never silently emit a formal unsigned APK |
| Local or CI explicitly sets `allowUnsignedRelease=true` | Verification Release only: skip FN Connect and update-manifest checks, sign with the debug keystore; never distributable as official updates |
| `allowUnsignedRelease=true` sideload Release without an update manifest URL | Skip the manifest check; signed releases still require it |
| Later formal version does not increase `VERSION_CODE` | Android may reject the update; release is invalid |

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: two concurrent reads of one namespaced album page make one NAS request; canceling one caller
  leaves the other caller and shared result intact.
- Good: the initial `0.1.0` package uses version code `2`; the `回声台` rebrand ships as `0.1.1`
  with version code `3`, reuses the fixed release certificate, and installs over the same
  `com.fnmusic.tv` package.
- Good: clearing namespace A during an artwork download cancels A, prevents its late file write, and
  leaves namespace B plus its files untouched.
- Good: two Grid consumers for one cover join one decode; a Compact hit neither satisfies nor
  visually substitutes for the Grid request.
- Good: a 128 MiB artwork setting caps the total under `cacheDir/artwork`, not 128 MiB per account.
- Good: after startup calibration, 100 small artwork writes below 128 MiB update the ledger without
  100 full directory sorts; crossing the limit performs one global LRU prune.
- Good: small Room payload saves reuse the exact baseline estimate; an actual over-budget audit
  evicts rows, performs one reclaim pass, and preserves account state.
- Good: `SetShuffleOrder([c, a, b], revision=12)` against canonical `[a, b, c]` succeeds and echoes
  exactly `[c, a, b]` plus revision `12` before the controller activates shuffle.
- Good: device A favorites a track, device B reloads `favorite-track/list` and sees it; neither
  device depends on a local-only favorites table.
- Good: manually deleting queue index 4 detaches the server paging source before mutation, then
  persists the explicit remaining queue so restore cannot append the deleted occurrence again.
- Good: four position ticks update only the progress flow; Home/My do not recompose and the existing
  queue list instance is retained until a structural player event occurs.
- Good: revisions 12 and 13 enter the snapshot writer in order, are encoded on its background
  dispatcher, and remain separated by the same structural durability barrier.
- Good: playback compiles against model and Media3 capabilities only; the app adapts data
  repositories and a typed bad-HTTP-status failure triggers coordinator-owned verification.
- Good: an extensionless FLAC stream on API 23 loads the bundled `arm64-v8a` library, content-sniffs
  as FLAC, plays to completion, and leaves MP3/AAC renderer selection untouched.
- Base: the FLAC extension extractor outputs raw PCM before renderer decoder initialization; the
  playback succeeds even though analytics has no audio-decoder name callback.
- Good: a switch A(revision 5) -> B(6) -> A(7) accepts only revision 7 metadata/artwork/lyrics even
  when revision 5 completes last.
- Good: `10.0.0.115` normalizes to `http://10.0.0.115:5666/music/api/v1/` and is shown again as
  `10.0.0.115` on the login screen.
- Good: `https://nas.example.com` and a bare host with HTTPS selected normalize to
  `https://nas.example.com/music/api/v1/`, using port `443`, while an explicit custom port remains.
- Good: FNID relay login, cover loading, and audio playback all carry the same access-code headers
  and `mode=relay`; authenticated requests additionally carry the user token cookie.
- Good: two HTTP/1.1 API reads each carry `Connection: close`, use distinct connections, and make
  exactly two server requests while `retryOnConnectionFailure` remains disabled.
- Good: an expired remembered token falls back once to its saved digest and securely replaces the
  token; a startup `500` remains on `Recovering` and enters the app after the NAS becomes reachable.
- Good: the login request contains the exact lowercase SHA-256 password hash plus the stable
  `deviceId`, and authenticated requests carry the raw token.
- Good: one NAS stores `alice` and `bob` as separate history entries; choosing either entry starts
  login immediately, while deleting one leaves the other's encrypted credentials intact.
- Good: QQ returns a plain `RTRT` lyric first, Netease later returns word-timed bilingual content,
  and the final selection is Netease only after all bounded provider work completes.
- Good: a translated line-timed Netease result beats an untranslated word-timed QQ result; among
  equally translated candidates, eligible word timing beats duration delta, then smaller delta
  wins, then Netease/QQ/Kugou breaks an exact tie.
- Good: the active lyric renders original text at primary size, translation directly below it, and
  timed syllables brighten while the SDK list scrolls without exposing phonetic rows.
- Base: a YRC result with unknown provider duration keeps synchronized line starts and translation
  but becomes `SyncedLine`, so no misleading word highlight appears.
- Base: a network failure returns valid Room page/index/lyric data where permitted, persists it in
  the process LRU, and avoids another request while retained.
- Base: a current artwork request receiving `503`, `429`, then valid bytes succeeds on its third and
  final attempt; a `404` makes exactly one request and becomes `Absent`.
- Bad: a response/artwork key without namespace, an unbounded map, a permanent negative cache entry,
  or allowing a cleared flight to write back.
- Bad: sorting every artwork file after each successful write, running three SUM queries plus vacuum
  after every Room upsert, or decrypting Keystore values in `AppContainer` construction.
- Bad: keying decoded artwork by cover ID alone, retaining decoded entries across an account change,
  or launching independent decode jobs from every composable.
- Bad: `SimpleCache`, `CacheDataSource`, a Media3 `ClearCache` command, or any normal playback write
  below `cacheDir/media`.
- Bad: setting every `/track/stream` item to `audio/flac`, enabling the extension only after an OEM
  decoder claims support, shipping fewer than four ABIs, or consuming a decoder built for a
  different Media3 version.
- Bad: `core:playback` importing a concrete data repository, UI parsing `errorCodeName`, or a page
  independently coordinating playback, cache, namespace, and logout operations.
- Bad: accepting a shuffle list that merely has the same length, or activating shuffle before an
  exact service acknowledgement.
- Bad: treating `data: null` on favorite create/delete as an empty-response error, persisting a
  local favorite as authority, or retaining favorite state across namespaces.
- Bad: deleting only by media ID, retaining the source paging cursor after manual deletion, or
  writing a snapshot before shuffle reconciliation finishes.
- Bad: copying position into the aggregate `PlaybackUiState` every 250 ms, rebuilding 250 queue rows
  for `EVENT_IS_PLAYING_CHANGED`, or launching independent snapshot encoding jobs before FIFO entry.
- Bad: using `mediaId` alone as current-presentation identity, combining a new MediaItem ID with old
  aggregate metadata, or converting cancellation into `NetworkUnavailable`.
- Bad: checking the security code only during login, then omitting it from cover or audio requests;
  this produces a signed-in UI whose media cannot load.
- Bad: storing a plaintext password or a replayable password digest in Room, unencrypted
  SharedPreferences, logs, Compose semantics, tests, or workflow files.
- Bad: sending a saved digest through the plaintext-password entry point, hashing it a second time,
  or treating a startup network miss as a reason to display the ordinary login form.
- Bad: `fallbackToDestructiveMigration`, an unexported schema version, or a cache row without a
  namespace.
- Bad: running a root `test` selector that accidentally schedules connected benchmark tests; CI
  names every non-device task explicitly.
- Bad: committing the release keystore/password, rebuilding with a different certificate, or
  changing only `VERSION_NAME` and expecting Android to accept an upgrade.
- Bad: returning the first provider hit, imposing a three-second whole-match timeout, treating
  romanization as translation, flattening secondary rows into words, or relying on a default-valued
  schema field that the serializer omits.

## 6. Tests Required

- `ServerUrlNormalizerTest`: legacy bare HTTP port `5666`, standard HTTP/HTTPS ports `80`/`443`,
  explicit/custom ports, editable host display, schemes, paths, embedded credentials,
  query/fragment, and invalid hosts.
- `ConnectionResolverTest`: direct HTTPS normalization, FNID signed lookup and candidate priority,
  access-code base64/header construction, relay cookies, and required/invalid access-code errors.
  invalid JSON, redirects, retryable status classification, HTTP/1.1 close with distinct connection
  indices, no transport retry, exact request count, maximum three current-resource attempts, `404`
  terminal behavior, and cancellation calling `Call.cancel()`.
- `SessionRepositoryTest`: expired-token saved-digest fallback and token replacement; transient
  restore publishes `Recovering` while retaining credentials; terminal auth stops retrying;
  same-server multi-account upsert, five-profile capacity, delete/clear, and `remember=false`;
  legacy token compatibility, cancellation, zero constructor reads, and IO-bound secure reads.
- `TrimMusicApiTest`: plaintext input sends exactly one SHA-256 lowercase hex digest; the saved-hash
  entry sends the exact digest unchanged and rejects short, uppercase, or non-hex values.
- `SerializedResponseCacheTest`: 8 MiB-equivalent byte LRU ordering, namespace isolation, same-key
  single-flight, one-of-many waiter cancellation, final-waiter upstream cancellation, failed fetch
  retryability, namespace/global generations, and late-persist rejection.
- `ArtworkCacheTest`/`ArtworkValidationTest`: namespaced memory/disk hits, same-key single-flight,
  waiter cancellation, invalid-byte rejection, atomic temporary replacement, hit touching, global
  cross-namespace budget, startup ledger calibration, no rescan for under-budget writes,
  legacy/temp cleanup, and clear-versus-late-write races.
- `ArtworkBitmapCacheTest`: exact-variant isolation, same-key decode single-flight, exact Grid
  prefetch, and decoded clear-versus-late-write rejection.
- `AppDatabaseMigrationTest`/`LocalStoreTest`: version-1 to version-2 preservation,
  `schemaRevision=1`, account isolation, LRU eviction, physical-budget reclaim, version-2 playback
  payload storage, estimated-audit reuse without reclaim, and essential-state-preserving clear.
- `CacheBudgetTest`: exactly 32/64/128/256 MiB artwork budgets, default 128 MiB, and no audio budget.
- `PlaybackServiceConfigurationTest`: direct `DefaultHttpDataSource`, access-code and relay request
  headers, 50,000 ms min/max forward
  buffer, 15,000 ms back buffer, no retained back-buffer keyframes, safe/idempotent legacy media
  deletion, exact shuffle permutation validation, `EXTENSION_RENDERER_MODE_PREFER`, and explicit
  unstable-API opt-in/lint.
- `FlacPlaybackIntegrationTest` on API 23: load `libflacJNI`, play the checked-in 16-bit/44.1 kHz
  extensionless FLAC fixture to `STATE_ENDED`, and assert no `PlaybackException`. App artifact
  verification asserts the AAR hash and exact four-ABI set; Debug and Release APK inspection
  asserts the same native paths, while Release mapping confirms reflective/JNI rules survive R8.
- `PlaybackSnapshotCodecTest`/`PlaybackSnapshotWriterTest`: strict version-2 round trip and rejection
  matrix, exact queue page segments, 250-item/unique-ID bounds, roam/frozen constraints, legacy
  rewrite, FIFO structural acknowledgements, background encoding dispatcher, stale-checkpoint
  skipping, clear ordering, and cancellation propagation.
- `PlaybackProjectionTest`/`PlaybackTransitionGuardsTest`: one-MediaItem field capture, monotonic
  presentation revision, progress-only queue reuse, structural event classification, exact shuffle
  acknowledgement guards, typed failure classification, and committed structural transitions.
- `TrimMusicApiTest`/`FavoriteLibraryStateTest`: exact favorite paths, sort and request body;
  `data: null` Unit success; account isolation; optimistic state; success revision; failure rollback;
  and stale server observations blocked while a mutation is pending.
- `PlaybackSnapshotCodecTest`/`PlaybackTransitionGuardsTest`: Favorites source round trip; invalid
  deletion rejection; delete-current selection; current-tail fallback; final-item empty state; and
  shuffle mutation invalidating the old acknowledgement.
- `AppContainerRuntimeTest`/`NowPlayingPresenterTest`: one application runtime, durable invalid-auth
  clear, account-switch cleanup order, `(namespace, mediaId, presentationRevision)` identity,
  A -> B -> A stale rejection,
  missing-cover enrichment, selective manual retry, terminal `404`/empty fallback, and cancellation
  without a retryable UI error.
- `LyricsSdkTest`/`OnlineLyricsSourcesTest`: LRC/YRC/QRC/KRC fixtures, native provider transport and
  LRC fallback, XML QRC extraction, word times, bilingual sidecars, corrupt input, and kana-only
  parenthetical annotation removal with non-kana counterexamples.
- `LyricsMatchCoordinatorTest`: all-provider completion, per-source timeout bounds, cancellation,
  all three candidate fetches per provider, terminal error classification, exact 2,000/5,000 ms boundaries,
  unknown-duration downgrade, translation/delta/provider tie breaks, and the `RTRT` regression.
- `OnlineLyricsResolverTest`: required cache schema invalidation, metadata protocol fingerprinting,
  SDK `SyncedLine`/`KaraokeLine` round trip, sidecar preservation, and original syllable start/end
  preservation. Player device tests assert compact bilingual spacing and auto-scroll.
- CI-equivalent local gate: all named workflow Gradle tasks must succeed and output four app APKs,
  two app Android-test APKs, and benchmark APKs.
- Formal APK verification: `aapt dump badging` asserts package `com.fnmusic.tv`, the managed version
  name/code, and `apksigner verify --print-certs` asserts one fixed signer. Install and reinstall the
  same signed artifact with replace enabled before distribution.
- Baseline profile check: both Sideload and Store merged art profiles contain app-owned
  `Lcom/fnmusic/tv` rules; on a connected target, run profile collection and the startup/frame
  macrobenchmark before replacing the checked-in profile.

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

```kotlin
// Wrong: the first acceptable provider wins, and a default schema field may be omitted on disk.
return fetch(ranked.first())
data class Envelope(val schemaVersion: Int = CURRENT_SCHEMA)

// Correct: await bounded provider outcomes, compare fetched content, and persist an explicit version.
val providerMatches = sources.map { async { fetchBestForProvider(it) } }.awaitAll()
return providerMatches.maxWith(contentQualityComparator)
data class Envelope(val schemaVersion: Int, val matched: MatchedLyrics?)
```

```kotlin
// Wrong: parallel custom parsers and models drift from the SDK consumed by the player.
val timeline = LegacyYrcParser.parse(raw).toLyricTimeline()

// Correct: provider transport unwraps bytes, then one registry returns the runtime SDK model.
val lyrics: SyncedLyrics = parseLyrics(raw, translation, phonetic)
val displayLyrics = if (durationDeltaMs <= 2_000L) lyrics else lyrics.withoutWordTiming()
```

```kotlin
// Wrong: every scheme without an explicit port is forced onto the legacy HTTP music port.
if (!hasExplicitPort) originBuilder.port(5666)

// Correct: preserve bare-HTTP compatibility while honoring standard URL scheme ports.
if (!hasExplicitPort) {
    originBuilder.port(
        when {
            scheme == "https" -> 443
            hasExplicitScheme -> 80
            else -> 5666
        },
    )
}
```

```kotlin
// Wrong: the access code is attached only to the password-login request.
api.login(headers = accessCodeHeaders)

// Correct: one ConnectionAccess supplies login, API, artwork, and playback request headers.
val headers = connectionAccess.headers(authToken)
```

```kotlin
// Wrong: hard-coded version values and a Release build that silently uses no stable identity.
defaultConfig { versionCode = 1; versionName = "0.1.0" }

// Correct: read one tracked version file and require local formal packaging to use the fixed key.

```kotlin
// Wrong: a stale HTTP/1.1 socket may be reused, or a hidden transport retry can exceed request limits.
OkHttpClient.Builder().retryOnConnectionFailure(true).build()

```kotlin
// Wrong: me() throws outside the runCatching boundary and crashes startup.

```kotlin
// Wrong: persistent audio disk cache and a command whose ownership no longer exists.
DefaultMediaSourceFactory(CacheDataSource.Factory().setCache(SimpleCache(cacheDir, evictor)))
PlaybackCommands.ClearCacheCommand

// Correct: authenticated direct HTTP plus bounded Media3 memory buffering.
DefaultMediaSourceFactory(createPlaybackHttpDataSourceFactory())
    // ExoPlayer also receives createPlaybackLoadControl(): 50 s forward, 15 s back.
```

```kotlin
// Wrong: cross-account key and independent duplicate requests.
cache.getOrPut("album:$guid") { api.album(guid) }

responses.getOrFetch(ResponseCacheKey(namespace, "index", "album:$guid")) {

```

```kotlin
// Wrong: every hot-path write rescans/sorts disk and reclaims Room pages.
writeArtwork(bytes); pruneDisk(budget)
dao.upsertPage(page); enforceBudgetWithSumsAndVacuum()

// Correct: update conservative ledgers and run exact expensive work only at a boundary.
trackedDiskBytes = trackedDiskBytes?.plus(newBytes - replacedBytes)

```kotlin
// Wrong: Application construction decrypts secure values on the main thread.

```

```kotlin
// Wrong: a replayable saved digest is rehashed as if it were plaintext.

```

```kotlin
// Wrong: every composition starts empty and Compact is reused as a blurry Grid preview.
produceState<Bitmap?>(null, coverId) { value = decode(repository.artwork(coverId, Compact)) }

// Correct: synchronously reuse only the exact variant and join one bounded app-scoped decode.
val initial = artworkBitmapCache.peek(coverId, CoverVariant.Grid)

```kotlin
// Wrong: a blocking call outlives coroutine cancellation and may populate a cleared cache.
client.newCall(request).execute().use(::decode)

```kotlin
// Wrong: length-only validation and optimistic shuffle activation.

```kotlin
// Wrong: a position tick invalidates every playback consumer and rebuilds the queue.

    projectedQueueItems = projectQueue(player)
}
```

```kotlin
// Wrong: encoding starts before FIFO admission and later revisions may overtake it.
scope.async(Dispatchers.Default) { PlaybackSnapshotCodec.encode(snapshot) }

// Correct: enqueue the captured immutable snapshot; the FIFO writer encodes it off main in order.
writer.writeStructural(PlaybackSnapshotWriteRequest(namespace, revision, null, snapshot))
```

```kotlin
// Wrong: playback imports concrete storage and UI guesses infrastructure meaning from a name.
PlaybackController(context, localStore, musicRepository)
if (playback.error?.contains("BAD_HTTP_STATUS") == true) verifySession()

// Correct: app adapters satisfy playback-owned ports and errors carry typed behavior.
PlaybackController(context, sessionStore, contentSource)
if (playback.error?.requiresSessionVerification == true) actions.verifyCurrentSession()
```

```kotlin
// Wrong: a multi-format endpoint is mislabeled and the OEM decoder may still win.
MediaItem.Builder().setUri(streamUrl).setMimeType(MimeTypes.AUDIO_FLAC).build()
ExoPlayer.Builder(context).build()

PresentationKey(mediaId)

// Correct.

PresentationKey(namespace, mediaId, presentationRevision)
```

```kotlin
// Wrong: erases user state when a schema changes.
Room.databaseBuilder(context, AppDatabase::class.java, NAME)
    .fallbackToDestructiveMigration()

// Correct: versioned, exported, lossless migration.
Room.databaseBuilder(context, AppDatabase::class.java, NAME)
    .addMigrations(AppDatabase.MIGRATION_1_2)
```

```kotlin
// Wrong: local state is authoritative and the paging cursor can restore a deleted queue item.
preferences.setFavorite(trackGuid, true)
player.removeMediaItem(queueIndex) // queueSource still attached

// Correct: mutate the NAS account and detach server paging before an occurrence deletion.
musicRepository.toggleFavorite(trackGuid, fallbackFavorite)
