# Android TV Interaction Contract

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply this contract to every landscape Compose surface controlled by a TV remote or touch input: login fields,
asynchronously loaded grids/details/song lists/settings, Home/My navigation, the immersive player,
its transient controls, current-song presentation, and the right-side playback queue.

The contract prevents four recurring classes of defects:

- D-pad events being consumed by an editor or an implicit geometric focus search.
- A route opening with no focus, or returning from a child route with focus/scroll reset.
- a track switch publishing metadata, artwork, or lyrics from different revisions.
- a focused transient control or lazy row disappearing without handing focus to a live target.

## 2. Signatures

The shared login field shape remains:

```kotlin
TvTextField(
    value: String,
    onValueChange: (String) -> Unit,
    label: String,
    upFocus: FocusRequester? = null,
    downFocus: FocusRequester? = null,
    leftFocus: FocusRequester? = null,
    rightFocus: FocusRequester? = null,
)
```

Login options use a real toggleable focus target, while the adjacent field actions remain
icon-only TV Material buttons:

```kotlin
LoginCheckbox(
    label: String,
    selected: Boolean,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    onClick: () -> Unit,
)

LoginActionButton(
    enabled: Boolean = true,
    onClick: () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    content: @Composable () -> Unit,
)

HistoryIcon(enabled: Boolean)
VisibilityIcon(hidden: Boolean)
```

Touch keeps the same command callbacks: tapping a login field enters edit mode, tapping a hidden
player reveals its controls, and tapping progress calls the existing relative `onSeek` callback
with `targetPositionMs - currentPositionMs`.

Library, navigation, detail, queue, retry, and settings commands use the package-local
touch-compatible `Button`. It preserves the TV Material button as the focus and D-pad target while
observing physical pointer gestures before that component consumes them.

The playback layer publishes one captured identity for the whole current-song presentation:

```kotlin
data class NowPlayingIdentity(
    val namespace: String,
    val mediaId: String,
    val presentationRevision: Long,
    val title: String,
    val artist: String,
    val audioFormat: String,
    val coverId: String?,
    val album: String?,
    val durationMs: Long?,
)

sealed interface NowPlayingResourceState<out T> {
    data object Loading : NowPlayingResourceState<Nothing>
    data class Ready<T>(val value: T) : NowPlayingResourceState<T>
    data object Absent : NowPlayingResourceState<Nothing>
    data class RetryableFailure(val error: AppError) : NowPlayingResourceState<Nothing>
}

data class NowPlayingPresentation(
    val identity: NowPlayingIdentity,
    val playerStyle: PlayerStyle,
    val metadata: NowPlayingResourceState<Track>,
    val artwork: NowPlayingResourceState<ByteArray>,
    val lyrics: NowPlayingResourceState<CurrentLyrics>,
)
```

`NowPlayingPresenter` is application-scoped, starts once, exposes
`StateFlow<NowPlayingPresentation?>`, and provides:

```kotlin
fun retryCurrentPresentation(): Boolean
fun refreshCurrentPresentation(): Boolean
```

The player owns stable requesters for `progress`, `favorite`, `previous`, `playPause`, `next`, `mode`,
`queue`, `exitRoam`, and `statusRetry`. Its normal side actions are icon-only and expose their
names through semantics:

```kotlin
PlayerControlOverlay(
    roaming: Boolean,
    playMode: PlayMode,
    queueCount: Int,
    favorite: Boolean,
    favoriteFocus: FocusRequester,
    modeFocus: FocusRequester,
    queueFocus: FocusRequester,
    // transport/progress/retry requesters and callbacks omitted
)

PlayerStatusRetryButton(
    focusRequester: FocusRequester,
    returnFocusRequester: FocusRequester,
    onInteraction: () -> Unit,
    onRetry: () -> Unit,
)

PlaybackQueueOverlay(
    items: List<PlaybackQueueItem>,
    loadedCount: Int,
    queueError: String?,
    canRetry: Boolean,
    onRetry: () -> Unit,
    onSelect: (Int) -> Unit,
    onRemove: (Int) -> Unit,
    onInteraction: () -> Unit,
)

fun initialQueueFocusIndex(items: List<PlaybackQueueItem>): Int
fun queueFocusTargetKey(
    requesterKeys: List<String>,
    currentIndex: Int,
    previouslyFocusedKey: String?,
): String?
fun queueRelocationFocusTargetKey(
    requesterKeys: List<String>,
    currentIndex: Int,
    previouslyFocusedKey: String?,
): String?

fun mediaBandReturnFocusKey(
    entryKeys: List<String>,
    terminalKey: String,
    lastFocusedKey: String?,
): String

fun catalogPageCount(total: Int?, loadedCount: Int, pageSize: Int): Int
fun catalogPageStartIndex(page: Int, pageSize: Int): Int
fun <T> catalogPageEntries(entries: List<T>, page: Int, pageSize: Int): List<T>
fun shouldPrefetchCatalogContinuation(
    currentPage: Int,
    pageSize: Int,
    loadedCount: Int,
    hasNext: Boolean,
): Boolean

enum class CatalogPagerTarget { Previous, Next }
fun catalogPagerTarget(
    column: Int,
    columns: Int,
    canPrevious: Boolean,
    canNext: Boolean,
): CatalogPagerTarget?

suspend fun ArtworkBitmapCache.getProgressively(
    coverId: String,
    variant: CoverVariant,
    fallbackVariant: CoverVariant?,
    onIntermediate: (Bitmap) -> Unit,
): Bitmap?

fun isHomeBackConfirmed(
    previousBackAt: Long,
    currentBackAt: Long,
    windowMs: Long = 2_000L,
): Boolean
```

Artwork ambience, transient player visuals, and non-paged library summaries use deterministic
projections that remain unit-testable without rendering a screen:

```kotlin
data class ArtworkPaletteSwatch(val rgb: Int, val population: Int)
fun artworkAmbienceColor(swatches: List<ArtworkPaletteSwatch>): Color
fun fallbackAmbienceColor(): Color

fun <T> retainPlayerVisualResource(
    previous: NowPlayingResourceState<T>,
    current: NowPlayingResourceState<T>,
): NowPlayingResourceState<T>

data class RetainedListSnapshot<T>(
    val entries: List<T> = emptyList(),
    val error: AppError? = null,
    val initialLoadCompleted: Boolean = false,
)

LibraryRouteStateLifecycle.update(stack: List<LibraryRoute>): List<LibraryRoute>
LibraryRetainedStateStore.remove(keys: Set<String>)
```

The persistent player re-entry surface remains:

```kotlin
NowPlayingPill(playback: PlaybackUiState, onClick: () -> Unit)
```

Authenticated surfaces receive explicit dependencies and actions rather than the application
container itself:

```kotlin
interface AuthenticatedAppDependencies
interface AuthenticatedAppActions {
    suspend fun verifyCurrentSession()
    suspend fun switchAccount()
    suspend fun clearAllEvictableCaches()
    suspend fun shutdownForExit()
}
```

## 3. Contracts

### Text input and focus modifiers

- Browse state is focused and `readOnly`; Enter/D-pad center is consumed on key-down and enters
  edit state. Show the TV keyboard after 200 ms so that the same center-key release cannot select
  its initially focused key.
- A field touch observes down/up in `PointerEventPass.Initial` without consuming either event. On
  release it enters edit state; the `BasicTextField` still receives the same gesture, gains focus,
  and the existing delayed keyboard request opens the device IME. A normal main-pass tap detector
  is insufficient because the text field may consume the gesture first.
- Back hides the IME and returns the field to browse state without leaving the route.
  `ImeAction.Next` ends editing and requests `downFocus`; Done ends editing in place. Losing field
  focus clears edit state.
- Every interactive sibling owns a stable `FocusRequester`. On TV Material controls, apply
  `focusProperties` before `focusRequester`; this ordering also applies to the transient retry
  button. Do not depend on an outer preview-key handler to reach a Material button's internal
  focus target.
- A custom focus target such as the Canvas progress control applies `focusProperties`, then
  `focusRequester`, then `onPreviewKeyEvent`, then `focusable()`.
- Plain password text is cleared before login and never persisted. A selected encrypted profile may
  expose only an `已保存密码` placeholder; never put its SHA-256 digest in Compose state, text,
  semantics, or errors. Editing server/account/protocol unbinds that profile, while typing a new
  password replaces the saved-password state. HTTP warning and login error share one fixed
  single-line status slot so the Login button remains inside the 1080p safe area. When the server
  address fails validation, the same slot shows `NAS 地址格式不正确，请检查是否混入全角符号` in
  the error color; wide-character normalization upstream means this can only reflect genuinely
  invalid input.
- Login has one TV-first layout for every landscape device. Do not branch on screen class or keep
  a separate phone tree. The same centered scrollable form uses the existing app palette,
  `widthIn(max = 720.dp)` before `fillMaxWidth(0.86f)`, and compact stable control heights so the
  complete Login button is visible at 1920x1080 while a smaller landscape viewport can scroll it.
- Keep Remember Login and HTTPS in one row as real `Modifier.toggleable` checkbox targets with
  `Role.Checkbox`, a visible square check mark, stable content descriptions `保持登录` and `HTTPS`,
  and explicit D-pad neighbors. Do not simulate them with `ON`/`OFF` text in generic buttons.
- Settings and login checkboxes use `Modifier.toggleable` as their single focus and activation
  target. Do not prepend a separate `focusable()` node: the D-pad may focus that outer node while
  Center activation remains owned by the inner toggleable node, producing focus with no action.
  Device tests that request checkbox focus must first request `InputMode.Keyboard`; a Compose test
  starts in touch mode and may correctly reject focus for a system-defined TV focus target.
- History and password visibility are 52dp icon-only buttons. Use familiar recent-history and eye
  glyphs, preserve content descriptions `历史` and `显示或隐藏密码`, and do not place `历史`,
  `显示密码`, or `隐藏密码` inside the buttons.
- Login history uses the project palette in one non-nested dialog. Each saved server/account row is
  72dp high with account on the first line and `server (HTTP|HTTPS)` on the second, a separately
  focusable delete action, selected-row treatment, and one bottom `清除所有历史记录` command.
  Activating a profile closes the dialog and starts login immediately without another confirmation.
- Login form commands use the local foundation-based `LoginActionButton`, including history,
  password visibility, login submission, and history-dialog actions. It owns a real focus target
  plus `Modifier.clickable(Role.Button)` so the same callback works for D-pad and physical pointer
  input inside the vertically scrollable form. Do not substitute TV Material `Button` on this
  surface; it was observed to focus correctly while dropping physical pointer clicks.
- Center field content vertically through `BasicTextField.decorationBox` with a full-height
  `Box(contentAlignment = Alignment.CenterStart)`. Center all command labels explicitly with
  `TextAlign.Center`; padding estimates are not a vertical-centering contract.

### Physical touch across authenticated pages

- Every TV Material command outside the player's enlarged transport/side-action targets goes
  through the package-local touch-compatible `Button`; do not import TV Material `Button` directly
  into a page.
- A stationary physical tap invokes the existing callback exactly once. Consume only the release
  after recognizing the tap so the inner TV button cannot publish a duplicate click.
- Movement beyond `viewConfiguration.touchSlop` cancels the tap without consuming the gesture.
  The owning `LazyRow`, `LazyColumn`, `LazyVerticalGrid`, or scrollable settings surface must retain
  native drag scrolling.
- Keep command callbacks unchanged. In particular, the Home random-roam tile still owns the same
  busy guards and `startRoam` path, and remote focus/D-pad activation remains owned by TV Material.
- The player transport and side actions already use an outer 48dp pointer target. Their inner
  controls use the raw TV Material button so one touch cannot trigger both compatibility layers.
- Instrumentation must cover a real pointer tap firing once and a drag scrolling a lazy container
  without firing the card callback.

### Current-song presentation

- Capture `mediaId`, title, artist, format, cover ID, and artwork URI from the same
  `currentMediaItem.mediaMetadata` snapshot. Increment `presentationRevision` whenever the media
  item changes or any captured presentation field changes materially.
- The publication identity is exactly `(namespace, mediaId, presentationRevision)`. A new identity
  immediately creates independent `Loading` states for metadata, artwork, and lyrics and cancels
  the previous presentation job. The UI renders a presenter value only when its complete
  `NowPlayingIdentity` equals the playback state's expected identity.
- Metadata, artwork, and lyrics may finish independently, but a result publishes only while its
  presentation token and player style are still current. Late A or B completions in an A -> B -> A
  sequence must never replace the newest A revision.
- Presenter publication and UI transition ownership are separate. The presenter still publishes
  only the exact current identity. While new artwork is `Loading`, the player may keep the previous
  same-namespace decoded artwork. Lyrics may only retain a `Ready`/`Absent` visual when namespace and
  `mediaId` both still match; a different song must never display or scroll the previous song's
  lyrics. Replace retained visuals immediately when the current resource reaches `Ready`, `Absent`,
  or `RetryableFailure`; never feed one back into the presenter or treat it as current resource state.
- The visual-continuity owner is remembered at the authenticated-session route host, not inside the
  player route. Leaving the player and selecting another song must reuse the same continuity state;
  disposing and recreating `ImmersivePlayer` cannot clear the last renderable lyric or decoded artwork.
- Decoded artwork keeps its complete `PlayerArtworkKey`. A new ready byte array is decoded and
  quantized on `Dispatchers.Default`; the old decoded artwork and ambience remain visible until that
  work completes. A current terminal artwork state clears the old visual immediately.
- Generate artwork swatches with AndroidX Palette and choose the ambience seed by a deterministic
  score that combines population, saturation, and useful lightness. A large neutral field must not
  automatically defeat a smaller representative color. Map the result to a bounded dark surface;
  missing artwork uses one fixed brand-neutral fallback, never a title/artist hash color.
- Poster mode generates one panel color from separate complete-artwork and right-edge palettes. The
  complete artwork is the anchor; the edge may contribute at most 35 percent and contributes less
  as its OKLab distance from the global anchor increases. Use population-linear perceptual
  averaging with no saturation reward or minimum saturation, cap OKLab chroma at 0.09, constrain
  lightness and preserve at least 4.8:1 primary-text contrast. Fade the artwork into that single
  panel hue; the far edge may only mix in a small amount of the app background.
- Poster and cover modes render one Accompanist `KaraokeLyricsView` backed by `SyncedLyrics`.
  It keeps multiple nearby lines in a compact vertically scrolling list, progressively highlights
  eligible karaoke syllables, shows translation directly below its source line, and hides phonetic
  rows. The lyric surface is display-only and must not enter the D-pad focus graph.
- Keep translation text only one typography step below source text. When the 124 dp control overlay
  is hidden, reclaim its reserved lower space for the lyric viewport; shrink the viewport before the
  controls appear. Place the active-line anchor above the vertical midpoint so more upcoming lines
  remain visible without overlapping playback controls.
- Key the SDK lyric subtree by the owning namespace/media ID and displayed `SyncedLyrics`. A song or
  lyric-resource replacement must create a fresh `LazyListState`; retaining an index from the prior
  timeline can place the new song on an unrelated row even when both time axes are valid.
- The TV player does not render Accompanist's intro/interlude breathing dots. Disable their drawing
  with zero dot size and margin; `Color.Transparent` is not a valid off switch because the SDK
  replaces the supplied alpha with its animation alpha and exposes transparent black as dark dots.
- Word-timed highlighting extrapolates a lyric-local position from the latest playback snapshot and
  `SystemClock.uptimeMillis()` on each display frame while playing. Re-anchor when the snapshot,
  duration, playback state, or complete `NowPlayingIdentity` changes; paused rendering uses the
  exact snapshot. Keep the global playback progress ticker at 250 ms and never mix frame-clock
  nanoseconds with uptime milliseconds.
- `Ready` renders the resource; `Absent` is a valid terminal fallback; only
  `RetryableFailure` exposes retry. A retry reloads only failed resources and remains bound to the
  same identity. Missing `coverId` may be enriched from full metadata, which creates a new revision
  before the newly identified artwork publishes.
- `NowPlayingPresenter` lives in the application container, not an Activity or player Composable,
  so navigation and Activity recreation do not restart or detach current resource ownership.
- A retry action may remove its own button. On click, request `returnFocusRequester` before invoking
  `onRetry`; after removal, progress is focused and Down returns to play/pause.

### Player controls, modes, and queue

- Hidden controls consume the first directional key, reveal controls, and focus play/pause without
  seeking or selecting an action. Center toggles play/pause and reveals controls. After handling
  center key-down, the player root must also consume repeated downs and the matching key-up even
  after controls become visible; otherwise that key-up can activate the newly focused play/pause
  button and immediately reverse the first toggle.
- A tap on the player while controls are hidden reveals them without toggling playback. Visible
  Material buttons retain their normal click handling. Tapping progress seeks to the proportional
  timeline position through the same bounded relative seek callback used by D-pad input.
- Visible normal controls have an explicit left/right graph:
  favorite -> mode -> previous -> play/pause -> next -> queue. The heart remains present during
  roam, where it precedes the available transports. Disabled previous/next controls are skipped and
  are not focus targets. Up routes to progress; progress Left/Right seeks exactly 10 seconds.
- The heart is outline when the current server projection is not favorite and filled coral when it
  is favorite. Its semantics are exactly `收藏当前歌曲` / `取消收藏当前歌曲`. While a mutation is
  pending it cannot start another request; failure restores the prior server-confirmed visual and
  shows retryable feedback.
- Normal playback supports `ListRepeat`, `Shuffle`, `SingleRepeat`, and `Sequence`. The mode button
  cycles in that order and immediately updates its icon and content description.
- Mode and queue buttons use familiar music glyphs only; do not render labels such as `列表循环`
  or `队列 5` inside them. Their semantics remain `播放模式：<模式名>` and
  `播放队列，共 <count> 首`, so tests and accessibility do not infer meaning from pixels.
- Roam hides the normal mode and queue controls entirely. Its graph reaches `退出漫游` after the
  available transport controls; normal queue/repeat rules do not affect roam.
- Roam next/previous and natural completion share one single-flight transition. A successful
  response replaces the one-item roam queue; exit restores the frozen normal queue paused, or
  stops playback and returns Home when no frozen queue existed.
- The queue is a right-side overlay on the player, not a route. It shows `loadedCount`, continuous
  row numbers, title, artist, and the current marker. Opening scrolls to and focuses the current
  row; selecting a row calls `onSelect(item.queueIndex)` and keeps focus in the overlay.
- Every normal queue row has an icon-only trailing delete target that calls
  `onRemove(item.queueIndex)`. Right moves row -> delete, Left moves delete -> row, and both outer
  horizontal edges cancel focus escape. Deletion is immediate and occurrence-index based.
- Fixed-height text controls do not rely on TV Material's default content padding for Chinese font
  centering. The roam exit label and queue retry label use a full-size centered `Box`. Queue rows use
  zero button content padding plus a full-size vertically centered `Row`; the title/artist column has
  explicit line heights and `Arrangement.Center`. Keep outer bounds and focus modifiers unchanged.
- Queue row keys are occurrence-safe (`"$mediaId:$occurrence"`). Each `LazyColumn` row creates
  `remember(rowKey) { FocusRequester() }` inside the keyed row and requests focus from a
  row-owned `LaunchedEffect`; never retain detached row requesters in an overlay-level map.
- On a queue mutation, preserve the previously focused row when its key remains. If it disappears,
  scroll to and focus the new current row; if there is no current row, focus the first row. An empty
  queue has no row focus target.
- Programmatic `scrollToItem` and `requestFocus` run only when the overlay first opens or the focused
  row key disappears. A normal D-pad focus move updates the remembered key but must not launch an
  outer scroll/focus effect; `LazyColumn` owns its incremental focus-following scroll.
- Back handling is layered: close queue -> hide controls -> leave player. Closing the queue restores
  focus to its queue icon. Returning focus is requested only after the disappearing overlay has
  left composition.

### Async routes, return behavior, and layout

- Authenticated page composition must depend on `AuthenticatedAppDependencies` and invoke
  cross-module operations through `AuthenticatedAppActions`. Do not expose `AppContainer` to UI or
  duplicate logout/cache/playback ordering in a page callback. Playback error display may use the
  typed failure's display name, but behavior must use its typed properties.
- The user-facing product name is `回声台`. `@string/app_name`, loading/login branding,
  launcher label, baseline-profile selectors, README title, launcher icon, and TV banner must move
  together. The authenticated Home/My top bar keeps its left slot empty when no media is available;
  it does not repeat the product name. The icon uses a charcoal background, a coral primary waveform, and a warm-white echo
  waveform. Keep the same flat double-wave mark in both `ic_logo.xml` and `tv_banner.xml`; do not
  add the retired teal node or play triangle. Internal package and command namespaces stay
  `com.fnmusic.tv` so a visual rebrand remains an in-place signed Android upgrade.
- On the first entry to a grid, detail, song list, or settings route, wait until the relevant async
  content has reached a terminal initial-load state, then focus the first actionable item in reading
  order. Do not request focus against a placeholder or an item not yet composed.
- Persist route-local `focusedKey`, scroll state, loaded entries/pages, and continuation metadata.
  Returning from a child route restores the retained key and scroll position; it must not refetch
  page 1 or force focus back to the first item. If the retained key no longer exists, use that
  surface's deterministic first-action fallback.
- A vertically entered `LazyRow` must attach its row-level `FocusRequester` to the last focused item
  that still exists, including a terminal "All" item. Do not permanently attach the row requester to
  index zero: after the row scrolls to its end, index zero may leave composition and Up -> chrome ->
  Down will have no live target. If the remembered key was removed, fall back to the first live entry;
  an otherwise empty media band falls back to its terminal item.
- A My media band's horizontal focus is bounded: Left on its first media item and Right on its
  terminal "All" item use `FocusRequester.Cancel`. Do not leave either edge to spatial focus search,
  which can escape to profile actions or top navigation after the row has scrolled.
- Full Artists and Albums use one `PagedCatalogPage<T>` framework. At 1920x1080 it renders exactly
  four columns by three rows (12 items) plus a bottom previous/page-count/next pager, with vertical
  scrolling disabled. Keep the existing fixed card dimensions and typography. On viewports narrower
  than the ~960dp TV class, `fittedGridColumns` shrinks the fixed column count (down to 2), and when
  fewer than four columns fit the grid switches to `weight(1f)` + enabled vertical scrolling so all
  12 page items stay reachable; the 12-item server page size never changes.
- Full Artists and Albums pass `size = 12` through Repository to the existing API so one server page
  equals one TV page. Include the requested size in every response/disk cache source key; a cached
  default 50-item response must never satisfy a 12-item TV request. The resulting domain `Page`
  must also retain that requested size when computing `hasNext`; do not request 12 and then construct
  a legacy 50-item page. Retain the API `total`, merge
  prefetched pages by stable media key, and do not add a "Load more" media card to the fixed grid.
- Full-catalog cards own explicit four-way neighbors. Bottom-row Down routes to an enabled pager
  arrow (left columns prefer Previous, right columns prefer Next); when only one arrow is enabled,
  every column routes to it. Pager Up returns to the last focused grid slot. Paging keeps focus on
  the pager, and disabling the focused boundary arrow hands focus to the remaining enabled arrow.
- Home playlists and All Playlists share one session-owned `RetainedListSnapshot`. My and the full
  Artists/Albums grids share the same retained paged snapshots; shared libraries use another
  retained list. A successful initial load is not repeated on route re-entry. An empty failed list
  may retry on the next entry. The store is keyed by the signed-in user and must be discarded when
  the account changes.
- Home's first content row is a fixed `Row` containing only Random Roam and Favorites. Playlists
  begin in the second-row `LazyRow`, followed by All Playlists. The Favorites route reuses the
  retained paged track collection under `favorites:tracks`; a successful favorite mutation revision
  refreshes that route so an unfavorited track cannot remain visible after returning from player.
- Saveable and retained state have different ownership. Session summaries shared by Home/My/full
  lists remain until the account changes. Playlist, artist, and album detail data belongs to its
  dynamic route key. After a route key is completely absent from the new back stack and the new
  route has composed, call both `SaveableStateHolder.removeState(storageKey)` and
  `LibraryRetainedStateStore.remove(retainedStateKeys)`. Do not release a key that still exists
  lower in the stack; reopening a fully removed detail creates fresh state.
- Remote artwork keeps fixed bounds and initializes Compose state from the application decoded
  cache so a page return does not flash the placeholder. Detail pages render a deterministic
  placeholder until their exact `CoverVariant` bitmap is ready. Artist/album lockup focus may
  prefetch the exact Grid entry for the destination detail page, but a Compact list image must never
  be stretched into a detail header; this avoids a prominent low-resolution-to-high-resolution step.
- A fixed-size decorative Home feature deck may explicitly opt into progressive artwork with
  `fallbackVariant = CoverVariant.Compact`. Check the exact Grid cache first, publish a real Compact
  bitmap as the intermediate frame, then load and replace it with exact Grid asynchronously. If the
  exact load fails, retain the real intermediate image. While neither variant is ready, render a
  neutral dark surface rather than a title or first-character card; remote input must never be
  required to make an already completed image load visible.
- Missing and failed remote artwork uses the same media-specific fallback on cards and details.
  Favorites detail reuses the Home Favorites artwork; artists use the same circular first-character
  avatar at both sizes; tracks, playlists, and albums use the shared centered first-character
  placeholder. Do not restore the retired generic record illustration on any library surface.
- Home/My player re-entry is a compact music pill with fixed measured bounds, cover/fallback,
  playing state, ellipsized title/artist, and a trailing cue. Focus may change border, surface, and
  scale without reflow. Its compact status row disables Android font padding, while the bold title
  enables it so fallback-script glyphs receive their full line box instead of being squeezed by
  invisible status-row font metrics.
- At a root route, Back from My replaces the root with Home. At Home, the first Back shows
  `再按一次退出`; a second Back within 2,000 ms saves a paused playback snapshot, stops playback and
  its service, removes the task, and exits the process. It must not clear the saved queue, account
  data, preferences, or caches. After the window expires, the next Back is a new first press.
- Use fixed `sp` sizes and explicit responsive breakpoints, never viewport-scaled text. The compact
  now-playing pill is `186dp` wide and `42dp` high at the default font scale. For larger configured
  font scales, increase only its height by `28dp` per additional `1.0` scale so both font-padded rows
  remain visible; do not use unconstrained intrinsic height with a fill-sized child.
- Landscape viewport adaptation flows through `AdaptiveWindow` (`ui/AdaptiveLayout.kt`), provided
  once by the `FnMusicApp` root as `LocalAdaptiveWindow` via `adaptiveWindowFor(maxWidth, maxHeight)`:
  viewports ≥880dp keep the historical 64dp margins, 600–880dp use 40dp, below 600dp use 24dp, and
  heights below 520dp additionally shrink fixed vertical margins (`shortHeight`). A 960x540dp TV
  viewport resolves to the exact pre-adaptation layout; `AdaptiveLayoutTest` pins the tier
  boundaries and the 832dp-content == four-column invariant. Pages consume margins/`shortHeight`
  from the local — never branch into a second device-specific UI tree, and never add another
  insets consumer: the root `BoxWithConstraints` is also the only `windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets
  .safeDrawing)` site (TV insets are zero; car cutouts/system bars are handled there once).
- Grid columns derive from available width, not a device class: `PagedCatalogPage` uses
  `fittedGridColumns(availableWidth, maxColumns = 4)` (170dp tile + 14dp spacing), All Playlists
  uses `GridCells.Adaptive(minSize = 193.dp)`, and the artist-detail album grid caps at three
  fitted columns. Card/tile visual sizes themselves stay fixed.
- Every touch-actionable control outside the player's hand-built 48dp targets keeps at least 48dp
  minimum bounds in both dimensions: settings choice/action buttons and checkbox rows, the queue
  row delete button, catalog pager arrows, library tabs, and detail back/tab buttons. The
  spec-pinned now-playing pill (186x42dp + fontScale growth) is exempt because its width already
  exceeds the minimum.

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: enter an async album page, wait for data, and focus its first album; open a child and Back,
  then restore the exact album and horizontal scroll rather than returning to index zero.
- Good: visit 100 distinct album details and Back from each; only active-stack detail entries remain,
  while the Home/My shared summaries stay warm for the signed-in session.
- Good: focus an album card, keep its Compact image unchanged, then open detail and immediately use
  the independently prefetched Grid bitmap when available.
- Good: open an artist with no cover and keep the same circular first-character identity used by
  its My card; open Favorites and reuse the Home Favorites heart artwork in the detail header.
- Good: tap Account, type with a phone IME, tap the center of a three-minute progress track from
  12 seconds, and request a relative seek of about 78 seconds without changing TV focus contracts.
- Good: render the same centered login form on TV and a smaller landscape device; the TV shows the
  complete form initially, while the smaller viewport scrolls the same tree to the Login button.
- Good: install `回声台` over the previous signed package and preserve app data because the package
  name and signer are unchanged while the version code increases.
- Good: switch A(rev 1) -> B(rev 2) -> A(rev 3), complete requests in reverse order, and display
  only A rev 3 metadata, artwork, and lyrics.
- Good: switch A -> B, keep A's decoded cover while B is Loading but clear A's lyrics immediately;
  B's lyric list starts from B's own timeline and current playback position.
- Good: render several nearby lyric lines in both poster and cover modes, keep each translation
  tightly grouped with its source, and smoothly move the active line as playback advances without
  showing phonetic rows or stealing remote focus.
- Good: focus the online-lyrics checkbox through D-pad navigation, press Center once, and observe one
  preference change; a pointer tap invokes the same callback once.
- Good: anchor at 1,000 ms at uptime 2,000 ms and render a frame at uptime 2,125 ms as 1,125 ms while
  playing; keep it at 1,000 ms while paused and clamp it to the known track duration.
- Good: a violet subject occupies less area than a pale neutral backdrop; Palette quantization plus
  scoring selects the representative violet hue and maps it to a dark readable background.
- Good: a mostly gray poster with a small red edge accent stays neutral or subtly warm; the artwork
  overlap fades into the same restrained panel hue used by the right half.
- Good: focus a retryable player error, press Center, transfer focus to progress, remove the retry
  button, then press Down to reach play/pause.
- Good: traverse icon-only mode -> previous -> play/pause -> next -> queue using D-pad; every icon
  has a stable content description and activating mode resets the control-hide timer.
- Good: traverse favorite -> mode in normal playback, toggle a filled heart, enter roam, and still
  reach the same heart before the available transports.
- Good: focus queue row C, append/reindex rows while C remains, and retain C; then delete C and move
  focus to the new current row after it is composed.
- Good: Home always renders Random Roam and Favorites together above a separately scrolling playlist
  row; entering Favorites restores the retained track position after returning from player.
- Good: move a My media band to `全部歌手`, move Up to the profile actions, then Down and return to
  `全部歌手` while preserving the row's end scroll position.
- Base: a media band with no prior focus enters its first media item; a band with no media entries
  enters its terminal collection item.
- Base: no current queue row focuses the first row; an empty queue owns no row requester.
- Base: roam has no normal mode/queue nodes and skips a disabled previous action.
- Base: My Back returns Home; Home Back once only shows the confirmation while music continues.
- Good: confirm Home exit, durably save the current queue and position as paused, then stop the
  player/service and remove the app task without clearing login, preferences, or caches.
- Base: an empty password disables Login unless a still-bound profile supplies an encrypted saved
  digest; editing server/account/protocol unbinds it and disables Login until a new password exists.
- Base: unavailable server history disables the history icon but keeps its stable 52dp bounds.
- Good: one server shows two account-first history rows, selecting either logs in immediately, and
  its independent delete button never invokes login.
- Base: a paused track changes its state treatment without changing the now-playing pill bounds.
- Bad: keying artwork only by cover ID; two songs sharing a cover can reuse a failed or stale attempt.
- Bad: clearing decoded artwork merely because the same-namespace next identity first projects
  `Loading`; this creates a visible background flash even though a stable visual exists.
- Bad: retaining lyrics by namespace alone or reusing a `LazyListState` across media IDs; the new
  playback clock then drives the previous text or an unrelated row index.
- Bad: retaining a custom two-line/three-slot lyric projection beside the SDK list, or making SDK
  line click targets reachable by D-pad; duplicate UI paths drift and steal focus from playback controls.
- Bad: driving word highlighting directly from the global 250 ms snapshot, or subtracting
  `System.nanoTime()`/frame nanoseconds from `SystemClock.uptimeMillis()`; the first visibly steps and
  the second combines unrelated time bases.
- Bad: generating missing-artwork ambience from title/artist hashes; the background is unrelated to
  the image and can jump to a misleading hue between tracks.
- Bad: selecting one highly saturated poster swatch, forcing a minimum saturation, and painting it
  across the right half; a small red or pink accent becomes a glaring unrelated panel.
- Bad: keeping every lazy row requester in an overlay-level map; a deleted/off-screen row leaves a
  requester detached from the focus tree.
- Bad: drawing `列表循环` and `队列 5` as side-button text; it wastes TV control width and makes
  familiar actions harder to scan.
- Bad: hiding the heart in roam, persisting favorite state only on-device, or allowing two favorite
  requests for the same Center press.
- Bad: putting playlists in the same first-row lazy list as Random Roam/Favorites, or deleting a
  queue row by media ID when occurrences are addressed by distinct queue indices.
- Bad: requesting first focus before data is composed, or always requesting index zero after Back.
- Bad: permanently attaching a media band's vertical-entry requester to index zero; once the row is
  scrolled to the end that item can be detached, so Down from the profile or previous band does nothing.
- Bad: relying on the API's default 50-item size, omitting size from the response cache key,
  appending a "Load more" card, or vertically scrolling All Artists/Albums on a viewport where the
  four-column fixed grid fits (scrolling is only the narrow-viewport fallback).
- Bad: showing a title/initial card in a Home feature deck while its real cover is loading, requiring
  a D-pad event to reveal a completed bitmap, or stretching a cached Compact bitmap into a detail
  header before swapping to Grid.
- Bad: keeping a legacy record fallback in a detail screen while the corresponding card uses a
  feature image or first-character avatar; missing artwork must not change visual identity by route.
- Bad: showing the IME on center-key down without delay and letting the matching key-up enter the
  keyboard's initially focused character.
- Bad: relying on a main-pass `detectTapGestures` outside `BasicTextField`; its own pointer input can
  consume the gesture first and leave the field read-only.
- Bad: rendering login warning and error as separate dynamic rows and clipping Login at 1080p.
- Bad: adding separate TV/phone login Composables or conditionally removing controls for a phone.
- Bad: rendering `ON 保持登录`, `OFF HTTPS`, `历史`, or `显示密码` as large text pills.
- Bad: rendering a saved digest as password bullets/text, asking for a second confirmation after
  profile selection, copying reference-image colors, or nesting each history row in another card.
- Bad: testing Login with semantics `performClick()` only; it bypasses the physical pointer path
  that previously failed on TV Material buttons inside the scrollable form.
- Bad: chaining `focusable().toggleable(...)` on one checkbox row; this creates two focus owners and
  may leave Center attached to a node other than the visibly focused one.
- Bad: renaming the launcher label but leaving old branding in loading, login, top bar, banner,
  baseline-profile selectors, or README; changing `applicationId` during this visual rebrand.
- Bad: copying physical-pixel prototype measurements directly as dp at 320 dpi and doubling the
  intended on-screen surface.
- Bad: retaining every historical detail key for the whole session, removing state while the route
  key still exists lower in the stack, or clearing shared Home/My summaries when a detail pops.

## 6. Tests Required

- Presenter unit test: drive A -> B -> A with distinct revisions and reverse completion order;
  assert only the latest identity publishes metadata, artwork, and lyrics. Cover enrichment must
  create a fresh revision, same-cover songs must make independent attempts, and retry must reload
  only `RetryableFailure` resources.
- Presenter/UI projection test: assert a presentation is accepted only when its complete identity
  equals `PlaybackUiState.nowPlayingIdentity`; old namespace/media/revision values project Loading.
- Login Compose/device test: assert initial server focus and the server -> account -> password ->
  visibility -> remember-login -> HTTPS graph. Inject Center, text, Back, and Down and assert exact
  text plus focused node.
- Login touch test: inject a real pointer click on Account, then assert it is focused, exposes text
  editing, and accepts injected text without a D-pad center event.
- Login command touch test: enter a valid server, account, and password, inject a real pointer click
  on the enabled Login button, and assert the suspend login callback runs exactly once. Do not use
  semantics `performClick()` as a substitute for this regression path.
- Login command D-pad test: from the same valid state, focus Login through the declared graph,
  press Center, and assert the same callback runs exactly once.
- Login option test: activate Remember Login through semantics/touch and assert its
  `ToggleableState` changes from On to Off. D-pad traversal must still reach Remember Login and
  HTTPS in the declared order.
- Settings checkbox device test: switch the Compose input mode to `InputMode.Keyboard`, request the
  toggleable node's focus, press Center, and assert Off -> On with exactly one callback. Inject one
  physical tap and assert On -> Off with exactly one additional callback.
- Login history Compose/device test: assert account plus `server (protocol)` lines, selected project
  color treatment, independent row/delete focus targets, one direct-login callback on selection,
  no login callback on delete, clear-all behavior, and `已保存密码` without digest exposure.
- Recovery Compose/device test: assert server/account/attempt status plus reachable `立即重试` and
  `切换登录` actions at both 1920x1080 and 1280x720.
- Login screenshot test at 1920x1080: assert headings, the shared base/error status slot, and the
  complete Login button are visible and non-overlapping. Assert history/password actions are
  icon-only, field text is vertically centered, and no legacy left-side branding/equalizer remains.
- Route state tests: assert first actionable focus after async initial load; return from a child with
  the same focused key/scroll; retained page 2 does not request page 1; a removed key uses the
  deterministic fallback; a route key still in the stack is retained; a fully removed detail drops
  both its saveable and detail-owned retained entries while session summaries remain.
- Retained summary tests: a successful list snapshot prevents another initial request, while an
  empty failed snapshot is retryable on the next route entry. Home/My/full grids consume the same
  user-scoped store keys.
- Artwork continuity tests: exact decoded hits are available synchronously, cache entries stay
  variant-isolated, Home progressive requests publish Compact before Grid and retain Compact when
  Grid fails, focused artist/album items request Grid prefetch, and a miss retains stable bounds.
- Full-catalog pagination tests: assert 12-item page slicing, total-page projection from the server
  total, `size=12` HTTP requests, page-size cache-key isolation, adjacent-page prefetch, and bottom-row
  column mapping to enabled pager actions. Device checks cover first/middle/last page focus handoff
  and detail-return restoration for both media types.
- Library fallback screenshot checks: Favorites detail matches its Home artwork, an artist without
  a cover shows the same initial on card and detail, and source search finds no retired record
  fallback implementation or call site.
- Artwork ambience tests: a colorful minority swatch beats a large neutral backdrop, black margins
  do not defeat a valid color, every mapped surface stays dark, and missing artwork returns the one
  fixed brand neutral.
- Poster panel color tests: a divergent right-edge accent stays closer to the complete-artwork
  result than a related edge correction, neutral artwork stays neutral, a warm cover remains warm,
  OKLab chroma is at most 0.09, and primary-text contrast is at least 4.8:1.
- Player visual transition tests: artwork `Loading` may retain prior same-namespace `Ready`/`Absent`;
  lyric `Loading` retains only the same namespace plus media ID across revisions. A media-ID change
  rejects prior lyrics, a namespace change retains nothing, and current terminal states replace immediately.
- Player lyric position tests assert playing extrapolation, paused stability, backward-time
  clamping, negative-position clamping, and duration clamping.
- Player lyric device test: inspect poster and cover modes at 1920x1080 and 1280x720; assert only
  the SDK scrolling surface is present, nearby lines move when playback advances, original and
  translation remain tightly grouped and readable, phonetic text is absent, and lyrics cannot take
  remote focus.
- Player device test: assert the normal icon-only graph reaches all transports, mode, and queue;
  no visible mode/queue labels exist; content descriptions identify all four modes and the queue;
  four activations complete the mode cycle.
- Favorite device test: assert outline/filled semantics, one mutation per activation, rollback on
  failure, and heart reachability in both normal and roam graphs.
- Retry device test: navigate play/pause -> progress -> retry, activate it, assert the retry node is
  removed and progress is focused, then assert Down restores play/pause.
- Queue device test: opening focuses current, selection uses the item's real `queueIndex`, a retained
  row keeps focus across mutation, row/delete Left/Right stays local, and deleting the focused row
  moves focus to the new current row. Deleting the final row closes the overlay and restores the
  queue action.
- Home/Favorites device test: assert the fixed Random Roam/Favorites first row, playlist-only second
  row, Favorites empty/list/error states, retained scroll, and refresh after an unfavorite revision.
- My media-band focus tests: assert the pure return-key projection preserves the last live media or
  terminal key, falls back after removal, and selects the terminal key for an empty band. On device,
  scroll each media band to its terminal item, leave it vertically, re-enter it, and assert focus and
  horizontal scroll both remain at that terminal item.
- Queue/roam bounds test: compare unmerged text bounds with the owning semantics bounds and assert
  the roam label center and queue title/artist group center match their fixed-height containers.
- Back device test: assert queue -> controls -> player ordering, My -> Home, one Home Back only shows
  the prompt, and the confirmed Back saves paused playback, stops the MediaSession service, and
  removes the task.
- Roam device test: assert mode and queue semantics are absent, disabled transports are skipped, and
  the remaining graph reaches exit roam.
- Player progress device test: reveal controls, move Up from play/pause, seek Right, and assert the
  progress value increases by exactly 10 seconds while focus stays on progress; Down returns to
  play/pause.
- Player touch test: click the center of the progress node at 12/180 seconds and assert the existing
  relative seek callback receives approximately +78 seconds.
- Player state test: exit roam restores the previous queue paused, while no frozen queue produces
  `STATE_NONE` with an empty queue.
- Capture and inspect player-controls and player-queue screenshots on an Android TV API 36 target at
  both 1920x1080 and 1280x720 (320 dpi). Assert nonblank output, no clipped/overlapping text, stable
  icon/control bounds, readable focus state, current-row visibility, and a right-side queue that does
  not obscure required player controls incoherently.
- Screenshot test at 1920x1080 also covers login base/error and the Home now-playing pill; assert the
  complete Login button is visible, the pill remains `372` physical pixels wide with at least `74`
  physical pixels of height at 320 dpi, and no lower title glyph is clipped at the configured font
  scale. Inspect rendered title pixels, not only semantic bounds.
- Brand resource check: search user-facing sources for the retired product name, assert the merged
  manifest label resolves to `回声台`, visually inspect the double-wave mark at launcher size, and
  verify the newly versioned signed APK installs with replace over the prior package.
- Home device test: focus the now-playing pill, press Center once, and assert the player title and
  progress semantics are present. Theme tests keep primary, muted, and status colors readable on
  the root background.
- Architecture check: authenticated UI sources contain no `AppContainer`, `BAD_HTTP_STATUS`, or
  direct logout/verification call; coordinator order tests cover switch-account and invalid auth.

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

// during the new current resource's Loading window.
